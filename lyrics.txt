Rise Against - Give It All


Break through the undertow
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Cough words I can't speak, so I
Stop my struggling
Then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

I give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottom's where we live
And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking under tension
Before far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses
Up from the dirt

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me
You might also like
Breathe (breathe)
The air we give (give)
The life we live (live)
Our pulses racing distances
(Breathe) so wet my tongue
(Give) break into song
(Live) through seas of competition

So please believe your eyes
A sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight
Home tonight

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Today I offer all myself to this
I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all
Now there's a reason
There's a reason
To give it all

Eluveitie - Inis Mona


Welcome to the land of questions
Welcome to the isle of lore
Where the veil came crumbling down
There it all began
The germination
Unveiling a cryptic door
There it was revealed
Hopes and aspirations
Unclosing an enthralled door

Escalate the sense
Enhancing to join the dawn

I close my eyes, Inis Mona
And reminisce of those palmy days
I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
As long as I breathe
I'll call you my home

20 years I have walked your barrows
Years of emulous youth
I followed the path of the wise
There it all was sown
The inspiration
Removing the seven seals
There it was revealed
Enigma of freedom
Unclosing an unseen door

In Flames - Only for the Weak


I can't tolerate your sadness
'Cause it's me you are drowning (You're drowning me)
I won't allow any happiness
'Cause every time you laugh, I feel so guilty (Guilty)
I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret?
I've become the lie, beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
No need for sympathy
The misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
'Cause it's me you're draining (You're draining me)
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day
'Cause every time you run, I fall behind, I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man, here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie

Sabaton - The Price of a Mile


Throw your soldiers into positions
Once there is no escape
And they will prefer death to flight

Hear the sound of the machine gun
Hear it echo in the night
Mortars firing, rains the scene
Scars the fields that once were green
It's a stalemate at the front line
Where the soldiers rest in mud
Roads and houses, all is gone
There's no glory to be won
Know that many men will suffer
Know that many men will die
Half a million lives at stake
Ask the fields of Passchendaele
And as night falls the general calls
And the battle carries on and on
What is the purpose of it all?
What's the price of a mile?

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young men's lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out

Still no glory has been won
Know that many men has suffered
Know that many men has died
Six miles of ground has been won
Half a million men are gone
And as the men crawled the general called
And the killing carried on and on
What was the purpose of it all?
What's the price of a mile?

Disturbed - The Sound of Silence


Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
You might also like
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence

Nightwish - Élan


Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn
The meadows of heaven await harvest
The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, free fall awaits the brave...

Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come!
Surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

The answer to the riddle before your eyes
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writings on the garden's book, in the minute of a lover's look
You might also likeBuilding a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand...

Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come!
Surf the clouds, race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great Élan, dance a jig at the funeral

Come!
Taste the wine, race the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time

War is coming swiftly
The border's closing in
We're a company of soldiers
Mere forty rifles strong!
All alone!
Stand alone!

Ardenner ground is burning
And Rommel is at hand
As the Blitzkrieg's pushing harder
The war is all around!
All around!
Hold your ground!

Fight for eighteen days of battles
No odds are on our side
Few will fight for all, until the bullets are gone

We, we will resist and bite!
Bite hard, cause we are all in sight!
We, we take up arms and fight!
Fight hard, resist and do what's right!

We will tell them with a smile
We'll surprise them with a laugh!

Temperance - Diamanti


I remember I used to believe we were here just passing (by)
I gave up to a life without purpose and love
I woke up every night in tears and I always wondered (why)
Then a voice in my head put an end to my cries...

Close your eyes, pretend the light's off now
No matter where you are, they'll soon reveal their name

Piovono diamanti dall'oscurita'
Puo' non sembrar vero
Ma questa e' la realta'

Scendon come grandine senza ostilita'
Senza alcuna bugia
Piovono diamanti ma della verita'

In Flames - Burn


We're in the ruins of dreams
Vultures and their dead-end screams
The fragile sanctuary of home
Spit me out, find another clone
Need a revolution
To find the lost evolution
Waiting for the wind to turn
Avoiding truth and never learn
Never learn, never learn, never learn

So burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes, let the flames be seen far and wide
Burn, burn, burn, the world needs to see
With open eyes

Drop the bombs, build anew
Purge our thoughts for different views
Different mantra, different beat
Still heading for eternal sleep
Devoured by constant pressure
Always for someone else’s pleasure
Not sure what you see in the scope
Afraid we're running out of hope
Out of hope, out of hope, out of hope

In Flames - Delight and Angers


Everyday takes figuring out how to live
Sometimes it feels like a mistake
Sometimes it's a winner's parade
Delight and angers
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be

Please heal me, I can't sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything
Make me feel unbreakable, lie and set me free

I feel the fear takes hold
Afraid this hell I create is my own
Calm my franticness, I can't take it anymore
This used to be my own world, but now I've lost control

Please heal me, I can't sleep
Thought I was unbreakable, but this is killing me
Call me, everything
Make me feel unbreakable, lie and set me free

Chasing leftovers
Under the fading sun
Searching for shelter
I feel my time has come

Bullet for My Valentine - You Want a Battle? (Here's a War)


We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war

Down eyes of shame
Made to feel dead again
Your words cut deep
Your lies are fueled by your need for deceit
Too scared to speak
You're only alive when you torture the weak
Now hear me roar

I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war!
I will not take this anymore

Don't be afraid
No remorse, no restraint
These scars won't heal
Now you're the victim I'm making you feel
Like you are me
I need you to know what you've done can you hear?
Can you hear me roar?

Metallica - Fade to Black



Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free


Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one!

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill, or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
Oh, when least expected, cloud connected

Sabaton - Poltava (English Version)


Time has worn the soldiers down
Marched for many miles
In the eastern lands so cursed
Time to make a stand
Tsar has scorched his nation's land
Nothing to be found
Hunger grasps the soldiers heart
20,000 strong

Listen excuse for a king
Trust me, this fight you can't win

(Poltava)
Rode to certain death and pain
(Poltava)
Swedish soldiers met their Bane
(Poltava)
Sacrificed their lives in vain
Poltava

In the shade of morning mist
Advancing on their foe
Bullets break the silent air
Wasted battle plan
Swedish forces stand alone
King has left command
Rule is left to lesser men
Waiting for their chance

20,000 lost that day
They bled the ground
Peace they found
There's no sign of victory
King Carolus had to flee
And leave the land
Leave command


Madness, curse your feeble horde
Fear me, you'll die by my sword

Æther Realm - Death

Sister dear, I never dreamed that I would find you
In the light of the dying day
I see the tears reflect the light upon you
And it's been so long since I've seen your face
Faced with the dark, I once chose wisely
I felt the light and it felt good
But three years, and I don't know what happened
But something changed in me
He feels numb lost in time
Hears whispers of a world in an endless night
But he won't miss the life he had
If this is really death then it's not so bad
Fed to the crows, they picked my bones
And left my body to decay at the whipping post
I can still see the blood running through my hands
And if I had another chance to live, I think I'd rather be dead
He feels numb lost in time
Hears whispers of a world in an endless night
But he won't miss the life he had
If this is really death then it's not so bad

Machine Head - Locust


Sweet caress grazes my skin
It's loveless, these hooks sink in
Behind an angel's disguise an insect preys
Mandibles cut like a knife, the reckoning

Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down

They come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls, consume the harvest
Young and old suffer unto the locust

Surrender, these veins are bled
Devour, nothing sacred
Strings pull the marionettes, see how they dance
Upon the winds that beget our pestilence

Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down

These vermin can't infiltrate us
Faith appears and holds a candle
Hark the angels sing


Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Tear the veil
The lies derail
Purity ever will prevail
Trumpets sound
The shattered crown
Halos of truth now they surround
The charade comes down
Down they come, the swarm of locusts
Skies above converge to choke us
Feast of souls, consume the harvest
Young and old suffer unto the locust
Down they come, the swarm of locusts

(T. Olsson)
At the gates of hell I stand alone
Waiting for the call
Now my time has come to pay the price
For the things I've done
I can see but there's nobody there
I can hear but there's so much I fear
In the dark
I can feel but my senses are gone
I can tell but the damage is done
In the dark
Return your soul it's the end of the line
Return your soul it's the end of time
Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right
The face of a demon with eyes turning black
Nosferatu
Can I believe what I saw in the night
Can I believe I was right

I come down on you like a ton of brick
All over so it's time to go

What has come over me?
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away to fall upon (The night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, bringing a question, "why?"

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

On a path to take it all away

To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore, hey

She with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance

A passing life each day, a carving on the wall
It's like a night without awakening
The truth is lost and maybe never to be found
Like the shadows of my pantomime

When all the world is gathered for the final feast
Will there be someone to believe in me?
Voices echoing in my distorted mind
Is this for real or just a dream?
(Am I losing my mind? I am not afraid, my dear!)

Sing for me, angel of afterlife, calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula!
And may the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony!

Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail!
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen

It all becomes clear
The truth will appear
Forever I'm there for you and sing

Don't want to think about the lie that follows me!

All becomes clear
But no one will hear my testimony

I am your angel of afterlife, calming you down
Silence inside your nebula
And when the wrong turns to right in a celestial light
I'll heed your testimony

Sing for me, angel of afterlife, calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula!
And may the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony!

A pocketful of posies
Ashes, ashes

Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark


I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night, or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

And turned around, and no one's there?

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Friend or foe? there's no way to know
Through the battlefield of life it's kill or be killed
So many times it's a matter of degree
From being up on your luck to down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

It's times like these when lines are drawn
Which side of the fence are you standing on?
There will come a day not so far away
When the hunter becomes the prey
(And you will pay)

Rise Against - Tip the Scales


Are we so alone
So distant
So forgotten
As we think ourselves to be?
These are our lives
But did they ever even matter?
Are we worth remembering?

These machines feed on the tears
Of broken lives and dying dreams
We're throwing wrenches in the gears
Our lives will not be lived in vain

When this is all said and done
We spent this life on the run
Judged by the company we keep
Our language, buried inside
These lungs that keep us alive
We breathe so selfishly

Promises we plan to break
Are made in whispered voices
Cause our despair knows many names
We make mistakes
But we apologize with roses
We never stop to smell along the way

Our lives will not be lived in vain

When this is all said and done
We spent this life on the run
Judged by the company we keep
Our language, buried inside
These lungs that keep us alive
We breathe so selfishly

We fell from the sky today
We melt into balls of clay
We sell ourselves everyday
Don't tell me how to live this way

Pushed so far to the edge
We teeter just on the brink
You can lead me to the bloodbath
But you can't make me drink
As these machines feed on the tears
Of broken lives and dying dreams
We're throwing wrenches in the gears
Our lives will not be lived in vain
My life will not be lived in vain

In Flames - Trigger


Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you
I need to find something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can you please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today there are only a few
The sign of times my friend
You might also like
Avoid infinity?
Are you for real?

(Just scratch the surface, and you will find)
(Something to blame for a long lost time)

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today there are only a few
The sign of times my friend

Arch Enemy - Reason to Believe


There's a scar on your heart
But your journey's just begun
A distant light that's worth the fight
The story's far from done
Stop hurting yourself
Those tired sores have nothing more to bleed

Self-hatred, I know it well
It's dragging you down
Listen to me now

There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe

They don't understand you
And they hate what they don't understand
You are more than they'll ever know
Like sand through your fingers
Don't let your life slip away
This prison of glass can't hold you back no more
You might also like
Self-hatred, I know it well

Always keep on fighting my friend
There's a reason to believe
There's a reason to believe again
There's a reason to go on
Listen to me
Always keep on fighting my friend

Slipknot - The Devil in I


Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven

You and I can't decide
Which of us was taken for granted
Make amends
Some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother

You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem
You might also like
Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil

I'm not your Devil anymore
Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, depravation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So, step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

So, step inside
Step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I

Into the night on fire they walked
And not one of them came back
Pray that into the final thunder they march
In the wake of martyr death

Into the dome of demons they walk
With the bible in their hands
Pray that into the night of silence they fought
And as one they held their brеath

Forced to believе that the Heavens strike back
Lined up to die in despair
One-by-one torn to dust and all sworn to the black
Signed up and ready to swear

R.E.M. - Losing My Religion



Oh, life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
You might also like
Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now, I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream

Eluveitie - Rebirth


Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

These dreadful shades
Dancing in my dwindling sight
And crying out these hollow words
A straying soul in my scorching flesh
Dying down amid this fucking blaze
My swooning world
Infested by strident cries
In a worship of the void

All vanishing in a dull and distant noise

Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left
You might also like
This was my rebirth

As one with pain and with distress
Sweet surrender in serenity
Will I remember this womb at all?
Will I ever know?

Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

I am not here
I do not last
I am the grain in the earth
I am the wave in the deep sea
I am the softly whispered word
In the murmuring autumn breeze
In front of Antumnos' gate
I beheld the mirror in the lake
Recognize I did not
Nor did I comprehend
Oh bright sun of the night I lift my eyes up to thee
Oh ye amber golden light let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, oh nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness when nothing is left

This was my rebirth

Sabaton - The Attack of the Dead Men


Turmoil at the front
Wilhelm's forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again

Two combatants spar
Hindenburg against the Tsar
Move in 12 battalions large
Into a Russian counter-charge
They'll be fighting for their lives
As their enemy revives
Russians won't surrender, no
Striking fear into their foe

Æther Realm - Swampwitch


Something not of this realm
Has sent a chill running down your spine
Intruder! The call raised the alarm
For centuries, for far to long
Trespassed upon her land
The time has come for reaping what we've sown

A cloud of smoke and a flash of light
Should have prepared ourselves for horror's strike
Now there's nothing left to do
As we await our doom

As we begin to melt
Flesh suddenly made liquid, our skeletons unzip themselves
Above the chaos, the moon begins to rise
Come daylight, none will be left alive

For we've fallen on the wrath of the witch
With cold hands and heart of stone
She'll tear our flesh from bone
Swampwitch!

This punishment, long in the making
You've brought upon yourself

The Swampwitch cometh to break my back
She drank my tears and ate my sack
The Swampwitch cut off my limbs and threw
Them all into her Swampwitch brew
The Swampwitch cometh, you're next in line
Recite your prayers, you're out of time
The Swampwitch, she will dine

For we've fallen on the wrath of the witch
With cold hands and heart of stone
She'll tear our flesh from bone

Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love ‘n loss


Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman’s noose
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I’ll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love

You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever

Blind Guardian - Mirror Mirror

Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That tomorrow bears insanity?
Gone's the wisdom of a thousand years
A world in fire, in chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far

I'll better keep it safe

Hidden in my twilight hall
I know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?

The bitter end

Shall we dare the dragon?
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me

To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall

Brothers of Metal - Yggdrasil


Rising up from a day of plunder
The ale of yesterday has gone down under
The battlefield awaits my soul to Odin (For whom I wait)
Thor guide me through my battles
Lead me home (To Asgard)
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the hour of final judgment
Allfather, lead my way
When the fire of war reign
I will watch my brothers fall
Our names will be long forgotten
We live on forever
The victorious will rise to the glory of the gods

Powerwolf - Dancing with the Dead


Dies Irae
Dies Illa

Long ago in a time of twilight
Seven sins, seven hearts on strife
Lost her way in a storm of rivals
Stay safe at night, come home alive

Years ago in a dome at midnight
Innocent and immaculate
Fold her hands on the holy altar
A masquerade, all out of fate

And on her way to hell betrayed her Christ

Then she went dancing with the dead
Lost the lord and the spiritus sanctus, raving
Dancing with the dead
Fell in love with the temper of twilight, lust and evil powers

Long ago on a tale of moonlight
Painted lines of the pentagram
Holy words all are long forgotten
The spell is cast, the dread is done

Read the words of the secret rites
Lost her soul to the darkened fire
We burn alive for all the time
We all are dancing with the dead
Lost our hearts to the spiritus sanctus, praying
Dancing with the dead
Fell in love with the temper of skylight, God and lethal powers

I have sailed to many lands
Now I make my final journey
On the bow, I stand
West is where I go
Through the night, I plough
Still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong
I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators, but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset, they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go, I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams, they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks
The sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm
Blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now
As sunrise comes, the darkness left behind
For eternity, I follow on, there is no other way

Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun

I, high king, sovereign and servant
Holder of divine, regality bestowed in the Omphalos grove
My kingship, the song of the gods
Thou shalt know me by my fruits, the abundance in which we grew
The signs and wonders at our feet, which the flight of the crows revealed
I am the crown of Gallia, I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos’ children, I am the will of our gods
Ambicatus is my name
My chosen (chosen) set forth to conquer, kindling beacons
My kingdom prospered and grew
Thou shalt know me by my fruits, from the Hercynan forests
To beyond the sky-scraping Alps, to which the flight of the crows led us

Rise Against - A Gentlemen's Coup


The pain, disorder, a cataclysmic dawn
We trusted but something has gone wrong
We bought it, but woke to find it gone
Impact in five, four, three, two
Brace for fallout, the radiation creeps
On cat's feet, we scatter in the streets
She asked me, "You think it's safe to breathe?"
It doesn't look that way to me

We stormed the gates, raised new flags
It's just the same old story
We seized the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
(stormed the gates, raised new flags)
(siezed the throne, subjugate)
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough

Afraid, we cower, to interests not our own
The power, to free or to control
We let it slip through our fingers to the floor
Watched as the bodies washed ashore
Nobody lives here anymore

Hear them whisper, voices from the other side
Hear them calling
Former foes now friends are resting side by side
They will never leave our hearts or fade away
Live forever
They were far to young to die in such a way

How many wasted lives? How many dreams did fade away?
Broken promises, they won't be coming home
Oh mothers wipe your tears, your sons will rest a million years
Found their peace at last as foe turned to friend and forgive
And they knew they would die

Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life, Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust

Hell is waiting where the ocean meets the sand
Cliffs of burden
Where the soldiers rushed into a certain death
At the shoreline, blood of heroes stains the land
Light a candle
One for each of them who fought and died in vain

While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands
Are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
(falling on me)

In your nemeton
These grey stone walls
Are cold and silent
As the fallen
Mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams

Epo, Epo why hast thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand, I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people

Were you there? Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
Falling on me

Children of Bodom - Needled 24/7


Since day one I've been crass and far beyond
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry
Before you judge me, take a look at yourself
Condescending, outlivin' in a lie

Despite all the pain in my heart grinding through
It ain't due that you hate that I hate what you do

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
A backstabbing motherfucker to the core is what you are

Everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7


You look down to me to see the scum of the earth to be
Fuck yeah, that's me, vile and obscene
I ain't happy about it but at least I don't judge and decree
To be better than another human being

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
Hey, would somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?!

Everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn

Sabaton - Firestorm


But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being
Nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

Warnings of an airstrike
The sirens scream out loud
Warnings on the radio
Of what's coming
Appearing on the radar
A threat from overseas
Planes on the horizon
Cast shadows on the ground

Bringers of destruction
Are ravaging the land
Fury of the bombers
A force to reckon with
Sets the world on fire
Then turns to strike again
Flames are burning higher
The bombs keep falling

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
Better run for cover, you'll be quick or be dead

Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens

Burn! Burn!

Carpet-bombing cities
And grinding them to dust
Able men and women
Will all be victims
Everyone will suffer
In the wake of their attack
Bombers show no mercy
A land in ruin

Homes are turned to rubble
When the airstrike has been approved
Facing their destruction
Fear the black wings of death
Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens
Burn! Burn!
Death from above
Die! Die!
Merciless killing
Burn! Burn!

Nothing remains
Cities ruined, turned to dust
All has been lost
Rise from the ashes and strike

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
Better run for cover, you'll be quick or be dead

Burn! Burn!
Rage of the heavens
Burn! Burn!

"Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!"

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine, has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

So, heute bin ich ziemlich gut drauf
Zieh' mich schick an, setz' 'n Hut auf
Die Rolex tickt, Mann, seh' ich gut aus
Hol' mir den Kick, den ich absolut brauch'
Yeah, wieder mal 'n Soloausritt in dem Poser-Outfit
Mach ich's mir nett, mach mich brett-fett, rauch' Shit
Wo sind die Bräute mit Poser-Auschnitt?
Komm' in den Club und genieß' den Ausblick
Die Braut ist schmuck und die ist auch schick
Ich sing' 'ne Hook bei der jede austickt
Meine Frau guckt krass wenn sie's rauskriegt
Hm, egal, mal 'n Ausgang
Muss auch mal drin sein, bin kein Hausmann
Brauch' unbedingt ein'n Drink, der taugt, ran
An die Bar, ich laber' 'ne Frau an
Für die Lady und für mich sieben Mojito
Mit einem Mal gefällt mir jedes Lied so
Tanz' sogar zum Song von Placebo
Bin blau und die Dame dito

Oh, oh, oh, du hübsches Ding
Ich versteck' mein'n Ehering
Klinglingeling, wir könnten's bring'n
Doch wir nuckeln nur am Drink
Oh, oh, oh, du hübsches Ding
Du bist Queen und ich bin King
Wenn ich dich seh', dann muss ich sing'n:
„Tingalingaling, you pretty thing!“

Wir sind blau, wir sind spitz, zu Hause sitzt die Frau mit Kids
Im Augenblick bekämpfe ich den Wunsch, der, wie jeder sehen kann, in meinen Augen blitzt
Alter, krasse Braut, sie sagt: „Lass es raus!“, und ist heiß darauf loszulegen
Ich muss Zeit gewinn'n, bestellt weiter Drinks – sie ist nicht mein Ding, versuch' ich mir einzureden
Lächerlich! Ich becher' mich weg
Barkeeper, hau raus, was in deinen Fässern steckt
Ich sauf's aus, weil es mich vergessen lässt
Meine Gedanken sind besessen von Sex
Sie will Offensive vom Mann
Doch ich bin besoffen, schiele sie an
Kurz darauf liegt mein Kopf neben der Toilette
Hätte nie gewettet, dass Kotzen meine Ehe rettet

Oh, oh, oh, du hübsches Ding

Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh)
See that burnin' body (hot)
Those boobs in a naughty (top)
Red lips so juicy (oh, caught)
In the middle of your web, don't stop
Take my brain, turn it off
Don't feel shame, don't feel love
More champagne for our game
It's insane, but it's, ah!
Do you wanna ruin my life, say what?
You wanna tell my wife, please stop
Things are gettin' real tight
I never thought you'd set me up, huh
All I wanted was a body for delight
“Lets get naughty”, you said, right?
Now you say you love me, day and night
Who's gonna save me from this fright?

Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem
Creatorem caeli et terrae
Et in Iesum Christum, filium eius unicum
Dominum nostrum
Qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto
In the night came the killers with the cross
From the land of war and plague
Came the prophecies of fate
And the word of God was long forsaken
On the stone upon the grave
Told the glory of the brave
And their legacy was all forgotten
In the hands of heaven sent
Come to fight and to defend
By the word we praise the holy name
Ereum Dominae
In the night came the killers with the cross
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
In the night came the killers with the cross

Bring hypocrisy and hate
And the land of God had long been parted

In the light of the moon when our lives are lost

Bad Omens - The Worst in Me


Is there nothing left to keep myself awake?
To keep the walls from caving in
When all they ever do is try to bend and break?
Is there forgiveness in the end?

I need relief, a failure's coming on
Just breathe in deep, it's taking far too long

I had you in my grip, but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free

It seems no matter where I look, it's always gone
With you, I know I'll never win
And it's hard to say where it went so wrong
And failed me in the end

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told (Oh, oh, oh)

I will not obey, my life is my own
Battle those, who wish to enslave me
Expose the lies, that enrage me

Never joined the herd, could not adjust well

No matter who they served before
Good or bad
They're all the same
Rest side by side now
Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

Testament - Native Blood


Whenever I stumble, whenever I fall
Whenever I'm pushed against the wall
This White man's world won't tell me what to do
Nowhere to run, my native blood
I wanna reach and touch the sun
Blistering my soul, but I can't feel
You hear me say "Get out of my way."
I'll do it my own way
Cross my path and get what you deserve

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
I'm alone
I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
So loud, native blood

Forever proud, so goddamn loud
It's me alone against the crowd
Right or wrong, it's the road that I must choose
There's no excuse, attitude
Got something here that I must prove
Live to win instead of born to lose

I learned to walk before I could crawl
Whenever pushed, I push back
Not afraid to throw the first punch
I'm never wrong, 'cause I'm always right
And when I'm wrong, I won't admit it
I'm the person your mother warned you about
They broke the mold after I came out
What gives me strength is my beliefs

Whenever I stumble, whenever I fall
I won't be pushed against the wall
This White man's world won't tell me what to do

Eluveitie - The Slumber


Step by step
We trudge on
On this scarlet road
Adrift and immured
Keen and uncured
Grimly walking the will of the one

One foot in front of the other one
On this steep road paved with our blood
Step by step we march a long walk
And breath by breath we just plough on

And I long to wake
Come up for air

But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand

One truth after the other one
Given and served we swallow down
Day by day we drink the blood of our sons
So they will walk this road again

Linewalking

Lift your eyes
I can see the light
March on, march on
Lift your eyes
You can see it too
March on voidwards
Lift your eyes
I can see the light
March on, we march on
Lift your eyes
You can see it too
March on voidwards
And I long to wake
Come up for air

But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand

Rise Against - Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated


So please don't ask me how
I ended up at my wits end
And breaking down
Pages torn from books we never read
Cause we're plugged into this grid
Don't pull this plug right now
Or then we'd really have to live

When I die, will they remember not
What I've done, but what I haven't done?
It's not the end that I fear with each breath
It's life that scares me to death

When we built these dreams on sand
How they all slipped through our hands
This might be our only chance
Let's take this one day at a time
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine
The time that we kill keeps us alive

Your words won't save me now
I'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow
"Get a grip on yourself" is what they say
Every hour, every day
Hands over my ears
I've been screaming all these years!

This might be our only chance
Let's take this one day at a time
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine
The time that we kill keeps us alive

We came in search of answers
We left empty handed again
Shots fired into the sky
Are now returning
Where the fuck will you hide?

Hiding from the laughter in the closets of our lives
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light
And now a hand's extending outward
Quiet comfort they invite
Do we dare take what they offer?
Do we step into the light?
When I die, will they remember not
What I've done, but what I haven't done?
It's not the end that I fear with each breath
It's life that scares me to death

Powerwolf - Night of the Werewolves

When I'm crawling through the night
God and Satan by my side
And I'm haunted in the dark
Sacramentum of the wild
Evil born as human child
Seed of wolf and man we are
You are like the dead alive
And you seal the time you die
Hear the call behind the dark
You can hide and start the run
When the seventh night has come
And you realize the mark
Are you taken all alone
Holy Christ in flesh and bone
Pray, the werewolves left the ark
See it's not a sermon, they can't call me back
And when the moon is high, we call the pack - we attack!

Run for your life

You can't hide behind a door
Dead and sanctified you are
See I'm not a sacred victim in despair
And when the fever calls, the pack is there - so beware

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully

Somewhere afar
A cry rang out
Wondrous words echoing
In my restless heart
A call I heard
In three different tongues
Of such awing majesty
Soft and silently
Whispering my name
I could not oppose

And so I set out into the unknown
I spread my arms to fall...

Nightwish - Storytime


It was the night before
When all through the world
No words, no dreams
Then one day
A writer by a fire
Imagined all of Gaia
Took a journey into a child-man's heart...
A painter on the shore
Imagined all the world
Within a snowflake on his palm
Unframed by poetry
A canvas of awe
Planet Earth falling back into the stars

I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear

I am the journey
I am the destination
I am the home
The tale that reads you
A way to taste the night
The elusive high
Follow the madness
Alice you know once did
Imaginarium, a dream emporium!
Caress the tales
And they will dream you real
A storyteller's game
Lips that intoxicate
The core of all life
Is a limitless chest of tales...

Rise Against - The Good Left Undone


In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I'd been missing
But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live. I walked away now

I see through you, I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
I see through you, I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God

Cover your ears and shut your eyes
'Cause what I'm about to say is gonna ruin your night
This is a call-out and I'm not scared to drop some names
You've dug your grave and you have no one but yourself to blame
I see the world in black and white
Because true color always fades under the right lights

I see through you, I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God
And when He has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you said

You've run out of luck and I'm calling your bluff
You stabbed me in the back but not deep enough
But not deep enough
I see through you

I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God

But now I'm right where I belong and I put you in your place
You said I'd never make it, you said I'd make a mistake
But now I'm right where I belong and you've got nothing to say

I see through you, I know what you are
I've seen the Devil more than I've seen God

The judging eyes watching me
Is all I've ever known
When I try to open up my heart (Heart, heart)
I am ridiculed and torn apart
You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

Today I break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies
No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good

Sabaton - Carolus Rex

All embrace me, it's my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting to sit upon my throne
No allegiance I will swear no oath
Crowned by God not by the church as my power is divine
They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time has come
I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies, see Carolus rise
With the Lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies, see Carolus rise
To the skies, see Carolus rise
Proved in battle, led my men to victory
No man alive or dead commands me, I answer to the Lord
Hear my orders, question me and die
What I say was said in heaven, and so it shall be done
I know I was destined to rule alone
All for myself I have claimed the throne
Born to rule
My time is now
You might also likeI was chosen by heaven

All that's thine shall be mine there's no stopping me
All over Europe my rule shall be questioned by none
All I see, give to me, that is my decree
My will be done
They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time is now
I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies, see Carolus rise

Would you pray if I said you were dying?
Would you be a little stronger
Or fall down on your knees?
Would you stay with me
If you knew that I was lying? (Lying)
Would you walk away
Or turn the other cheek? (The other cheek)

I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The nature of a truly desperate heart
Give me something real
That I can truly feel

How far will I go
Despite the foundation
I am falling
Sweet reflection
Will you save a place for me

Where am I heading
Could you grant me a haven
For what
I am punished, could I ever repent

Mother nature I'm wide open
Waiting for you to move me

Don't keep it from me
This is the free fall
This is the free fall

Define a way to stay alive

Arch Enemy - No More Regrets


You chose your path, don't shift the blame
You ran your course, you lost sight of your aim
Wrong choices linger, like scars remain
Long after the bleeding stops
There's nowhere left to hide from the shame

Never again
No, no more regrets
What's done is done, can't be erased
Know, know your regrets
Savor the bitter aftertaste

The crippling guilt, how heavy it can be
When searching for the right words
Hoping the truth will bring you peace
A lesson learned is good company
For the lonely road you walk
Each step forward, agony

Never again
No, no more regrets
What's done is done, can't be erased
Know, know your regrets
Savor the bitter aftertaste

5th of May, V-day's just around the corner
1945 the Fuhrer's reign is at its end
Jenny at the gates, as the SS open fire
There's no time to waste, the final battle has begun

After the downfall, a castle besieged
Facing the Nazis awaiting relief
Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free

And it's the end of the line of the final journey
Enemies leaving the past
And it's American troops and the German army
Joining together at last

One last fight, it's the death throes of the Third Reich
Justice shall be done, the final battle remains
Ammo is running low, they're depleting their machine guns
Every bullet counts until surrender is announced

After the downfall, a castle relieved
Defeating the Nazis who held them besieged

You can't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame
You have to cross the line just to remember where it lays
You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

You can't understand what lays ahead if you don't understand the past
You'll never learn to fly until you're standing at the cliff
You can't truly love until you've given up on it

That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

She told me she that she'd never face the world again

We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night (we have the rest of our lives)
We'll come clean and start over

When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind (we have the rest of our lives)

Disturbed - Down with the Sickness


Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Drowning deep
In my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of
My human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes
Violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon
In me

The sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that
Was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon

Sabaton - Unbreakable


By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march
Then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him

It's under crimson skies, hell's horizon
Our trap will spring
Unaware of our presence, they'll be marching
Straight to their doom

We are prepared for war, ready for fire
Stand by to charge
Counting down as they march into destruction
Their time has come

They'll never know, we give no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Leading them straight into hell

They will not live to tell the tale
We'll strike at dusk and fight 'till dawn
Tonight our foe is bound to fail
Our time is now, all ready at arms

Leading them straight into hell

They will not live to tell the tale
We'll strike at dusk and fight 'till dawn
Tonight our foe is bound to fail
Our time is now, all ready at arms


Chaos and disorder, sound of the attack
Charging down the mountain, frontal assault
Guns light up the darkness, mortars rip the ground
Like a force of nature shaking the field

They never knew, we gave no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Cut off retreat
Release - unleash
The beast within
Berserker rage is
Released - unleashed
A storm, a force, unbreakable war machine


Victims of the ambush stains the ground with blood
Fields of execution, murderous plan
Soldiers turn to madmen in the dead of night
Fighting with a fury, fiery eyes

They never knew, we gave no warning
We set a trap, they took the bait
Cut off retreat

Release - unleash
The beast within
Berserker rage is
Released - unleashed
A storm, a force, unbreakable war machine
Unleash the beast within
Berserker rage is released

Bad Omens - Mercy


Blinded by a fear of feeling, these are the kings we chose
Lost and looking for the meaning, I've been searching high and low
When we fade into nothing, when we go up in the smoke
We’ll beg God for a mercy that He knows we'd never show

On a canvas we stained with blood and painted with our sins
There's a candle melting and it’s burning at both ends
We'll take and take 'til it caves and drowns us in the wax it drips
Like a moth to a flame you never should've fucking lit

You can give sight to the blind
But you can't force them to see
You could take us back in time
But it wouldn't change a thing

If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from His home
And we asked Him if He'd take us back, He would surely tell us no
If God came down from His kingdom, He came down from his throne
And we asked Him if He'd take us back, He would tell us we can’t go

To a rat in a maze, the end is where the start begins
But if we made it out, I know that we would do it all again
We live and die in vain like treasure on a sinking ship
All in the name of a god we’d just abandon and forget

Is it worth the price we paid?
Is it worth it?

Marching ashore in the cover of night

Shake them awake with the thunder of guns

Failure will not be accepted, call for artillery strike, launch attack

Take what is ours, restore law and order
Back in control, push them further out to sea
Falklands in our hands, back under British reign

Into our fleet that will stop their retreat

Beyond The Black - My God is Dead


I walked across the desert a thousand miles
And every second cost me a thousand lives
And I close my eyes, and I pay the price
When all of nature's beauties wore off and died
You promised me the heavens would make it right
And I closed my eyes and trusted your lies

(My God is dead!)
I catch you, my soul and my heart
(My God is dead!)
While you left us lost in the dark
(My God is dead!)
You preyed on our faith and I gave you my life
(My God is dead!)
You promised me heaven instead
My God is dead

I watch as all our loved ones return to dust
The world we used to live in it drowns in rust
But I close my eyes and turn to the skies
With all the souls you gave us, with all those tears
You didn't try and stop it in all those years
You heard all those cries but you closed your eyes

Sabaton - The Final Solution


Country in depression, nation in despair
One man seeking reasons everywhere
Growing hate and anger, the Führer's orders were precise
Who was to be blamed and pay the price

Wicked propaganda turning neighbors into foes
Soldiers of the Third Reich searching homes
And then their former friends are watching as they are round up one by one
Times of persecution’s just begun

Ever since it started on Kristallnacht ‘38
When liberty died and truth was denied
Sent away on trains, set on a one-way trip to hell
Enter the gates, Auschwitz awaits

When freedom burns, the final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn, the curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn, the curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

Bad Omens - Said & Done


Old friend, don't you see me
With my soul on my sleeve and my heart left to beat underground?
Don't you leave me
With the hope and belief that you're coming for me

Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?
Well, when I've given up and all is said and done
Will you just look the other way?
Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?
Well, when I've given up and all is said and done
Will you just look the other way?

Half-dead, barely breathing
Fell apart just to keep my head up in one piece 'til I'm found
Well, I'm sinking
To the floor of the sea where you want me to be

Was I not good enough? Worthy of being loved?
Were you ashamed or just afraid?

Overdosing to songs you wrote
Poise and potions is all I know
When the world's a stage and I'm just a show

All right

We're scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight
There's an evil feeling
In our brains
But it's nothing new
You know it drives us insane

Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy

There is no escape
And that's for sure
This is the end
We won't take any more
Say goodbye

And now you're giving

With the feeling to kill

Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
'Cause you're the one we will find

By the sea and across the lands, with a calming drinking hand
Italian way! Grappa grappa hey! Deutschland lager, über alles!
If Aquavit left me feeling bleak, a pint of Bitters we'll make me cheers!

Hey hey hey!

Our clan is gathered here, and the plan is loud and clear!
Everyone in full swing, brothers of kin will attempt to sing!
No one cares what tomorrow brings, and the sauna burns down again!

Amaranthe - Archangel


We brood in a land that is struck by disease
A visage so vivid I see, but it's just so unreal
I mourn for the fallen demons, leviathan carries my will
Confounded, yet I am immortal, the ultimate torment I feel

Archangel rise, the trinity has synchronized
A remedy for humankind (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down
Against the odds we bring a bloodless sacrifice
From hell on earth to paradise (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Archangel has fallen down

See a red moon rise up, an omen of grief
The son of the morning descends from Elysium's creed
I sing for the fallen angels, I carry them under my wings
I'm frozen but still undefeated, for the abandoned I sing

Sabaton - The Carolean's Prayer


Far beyond their nations' borders
There's an army on the march
For religion, king, and glory
In the name of Christ their enemies chastise

Taking orders from the heavens
Through hostile fire they will march
Unaffected by the volleys
Facing death their faith will keep their fear at bay

Into battle facing the fire
Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line
See the white in their eyes
Caroleans are marching on
Put their lives in God's hand
For their kingdom and fatherland
See the white in their eyes
Caroleans are marching on

Morale and discipline unites them
A common faith to keep them strong
Always on their way to heaven
In the name of Christ, their enemies chastise

Ahead, facing the lead
An army of Swedes, performing God's deeds
Showing no fear, their judgement is near
Making their sacrifice
When the king and his men
Their enemies sight, prepare for the fight
Banners held high, ready to die
Hear how they praise the Lord
Into battle facing the fire
Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line
See the white in their eyes

Put their lives in God's hand
For their kingdom and fatherland

Kamelot - When the Lights Are Down


Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow in halo black
As black as the seal on my soul

'Cause when the lights are down there's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
And when the lights are down you're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite

Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
What can protect me from the past and all the things that I have done
She told me and then she was gone

But when the lights are down there's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions made a stand
'Cause when the lights are down she'll take me away
Tell me her real name
And in death we'll live the love we never had

Oh, come all ye faithful

United here we stand
We Sacrificed
The ones we left behind
Forgive me for my sin
I can't deny
The ones we have forsaken
The memories fade to grey
An empty shell
Their time will never come
The vision in my mind
Is clear to me
I don't know how to save you
United here we stand
We Sacrificed
The ones we left behind
Forgive me for my sin
I can't deny
The ones we have forsaken
You're walking through darkness
With fear in your mind
Through fire and flames
I am calling your name
My life is eternal
And Judas must die
The wind and the rain
I will show you the way
Whenever the curtain will fall
I hear you calling
My legion is holy
No tears in their eyes
With sorrow and pain
There is no one to blame
Whenever the curtain will fall...You might also like

Arch Enemy - A Fight I Must Win


I've lived in darkness
Stood in the light
Crawled through the shadows
Between wrong and right

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win

With wings of tin and feet of stone
I crash against the ground below
It's not the first time, won't be the last time
Got to pick myself up, get on with the show

One thing I know for sure
This is a fight I must win

I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One more fight I must win
Fight the demon dwelling within

Alone in my cloak of lead
Choking on words of advice
Heard all the answers
Most of them lies

I can feel the coming storm
There's a demon I have to control
One last fight I must win
There's a demon dwelling within
This is a fight I must win (win, win, win)

Bonnie Tyler - Holding Out for a Hero


Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero

(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)

A short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat
Where bodies lie piled
Hides his emotions
His blood's running cold
Just like his victories
His story unfolds

Bright, a white light
If there'd be
Any glory in war
Let it rest
On men like him
(Dead men will never come back)

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to Hell and back

To say goodbye

Bright, a white light
If there'd be
Any glory in war
Let it rest
On men like him
(Who went to hell and came back)

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
Going to hell and back
Oh gather 'round me
And listen while I speak
Of a war where hell is six feet deep
And all along the shore
Where cannons still roar
They're haunting my dreams
They're still there when I sleep


He saw crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
He charged and attack
He went to hell and back

Powerwolf - The Sacrament of Sin

Serpents of heaven befall us
Come when temper and lust are awake
Arise from the deep of the battle
And awake when lust can't wait
Send all misgivings to heaven
And unveil all the beasts in your head
Stand tall for the rain
Remember the pain
When in Rome we all attack
Time to see the sky forever
Find eternal life in fever
Time to copulate
And come alive and break the chains
Commit the sacrament of sin, in for the kill
The sacrament of sin, for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin, believe it or fall
All the night Neanderthal
Ten thousand times we have wondered
And prepared for the ultimate sin
Three times had our lord been forgiven
And three times we fell for skin
You might also likeBan all the morals to heaven
And forget all good manners in rage
To rebel in lust
In body and bust
Fornicate to break this cage
Time to see the sky forever
Find eternal life in fever
Time to copulate
And come alive and break the chains
Commit the sacrament of sin, in for the kill
The sacrament of sin, for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin, believe it or fall
All the night Neanderthal
Confess the sacrament of sin, mistress or wife
Sacrament of sin, lead a sinister life
Sacrament of sin, desire to call
Stand up high when cloth will fall
Commit the sacrament of sin, in for the kill
The sacrament of sin, for the sin is my will
Sacrament of sin, believe it or fall
All the night Neanderthal
Confess the sacrament of sin, mistress or wife
Sacrament of sin, lead a sinister life
Sacrament of sin, desire to call
Stand up high when cloth will fall
Commit the sacrament of sin

Orden Ogan - Vampire in Ghost Town


Far too long I'm lost in the desert storm
Wandering aimlessly and so war-torn
A deserted town appears in sight, for day by day and night by night
Her voice lures me back into the twilight

She says that I am like a leech (Vampire)
In ghost town
She says I like when people bleed (Vampire)
Vampire in a ghost town
Maybe this is the reason why all people leave
I all alone am the disease (Vampire)
Vampire in a ghost town

I think her thoughts, steered by her silent voice
A fractious force that leaves me without choice
I'll take the blame without reserve, and night by night and day by day
I seem to be en route and still I go astray

Poisonblack - Rush


I can't help but follow
In spite of going insane
For I know you'll swallow
The whole of my pain

I'm, I'm stepping out of the light
To feel what darkness can sow
I stare at the dead red lie
Just one glance and I know

All disguised beneath the smile
Of the temptress, siren, evil child
The devil's sweetest whore

'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making me feel so alive
'Cause it's only the end of the suffering
And I'm drowning in this rush
'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making it real for awhile
'Cause it's truly the end of the suffering
And I'm drowning in this rush
You might also like
I was down, now flying
Going nowhere fast
There's no denying
I need this feeling to last
I breathe in, I get higher
The ache fades from sharp to dull
The knives of desire

A thousand cuts still leave me cold
Give me more, this soul's been sold
And I hope this time I won't wake up dead

'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making it real for awhile
'Cause it's truly the end of the suffering
And I'm drowning in this rush

Don't blame yourself for what you can't ignore
Don't blame yourself for wanting more, and more, and more
Flesh on flesh, raising breaths on breaths
I love, I love the rush of death
'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making me feel so alive
'Cause it's only the end of the suffering
And I'm drowning in this rush
'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making it real for awhile
'Cause it's truly the end of the suffering
And I'm drowning in this rush

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

But I know

Rise Against - Savior


It kills me not to know this, but I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face, that this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

So, tell me now
If this ain't love, then how do we get out?
’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"
(Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

And the day pressed on like crushing weights, for no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

Unholy soil on me
A bracing wind of insight
Is coming from the sea
Unleashed by a broken shadow
I can sense an endless flame
The rain of a lost generation

Shout and cheer

Deep inside

Surrounded by vile creatures
Prospecting and obsessed
But I don't care about fuckheads

Sabaton - Rorke's Drift


News that came that morning told that the main force had been slain
Chance for peace and justice gone and all talks had been in vain
A prince had been offended and he has gone the path of war
Now that 1500 men are dead and the Zulu’s at the door

Zulus attack
Fight back to back
Show them no mercy and
Fire at will
Kill or be killed
Facing, awaiting

A hostile spear, a new frontier, the end is near
There's no surrender
The lines must hold, their story told, Rorke's drift controlled

Later on that fateful day as they head towards the drift
Stacking boxes, fortify, preparations must be swift
Spears and shields of oxen hide facing uniforms and guns
As the rifles fire, echoes higher, beating like the sound of drums

Zulus attack
Fight back to back

Brothers of Metal - Chain Breaker


Dark and ancient whispers
Echoes through the night
Tales of desolation
As the end of time is drawing nigh
Bringer of destruction
The wolf is growing strong
He was locked in godly chains
That wouldn't last for long

The leash could not domesticate
The violent beast within
And when the bane of Odin howls
The eternal night begins

When the twines that hold him start to yield before his might
The day will come when Skoll and Hati devours all our light

Chain breaker
He's howling in the night
Chain breaker
Brings havoc with his might
Chain breaker

The gods sought help from dwarven hands
To forge a mighty bind
Created out of mysteries
Too great for mortal minds
They started with the roots of
Every mountain they could find
The spit of birds, and breath of fish
With women's beards entwined

They thought they were so clever
When they brutalized the beast
But when his vengeance is at hand
He'll have a bloody feast

When the twines that hold him start to yield before his might

The stars will lose their place
Jaws wide open, vengeful
With a fire in his eyes
He will swallow everything
Between the earth and sky

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The blind men shout, "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers"
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime-time Belsen feast, yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
And lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies

As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun

Rise Against - Life Less Frightening


Suffering from something we're not sure of
In a world there is no cure for
These lives we live test negative for happiness
Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open
Single file like soldiers on a mission
If there's no war outside our heads
Why are we losing?

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening
A life less frightening
I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening
A life less frightening

Hang me out to dry, I'm soaking
With the sins of knowing
What's gone wrong
But doing nothing, I still run
Time again I have found myself stuttering
Foundations pulled out from under me
This breath is wasted on them all
Will someone answer me

Is there a God tonight
Up in the sky
Or is it empty just like me?
A place where we can hide
Out from the night
Where you are all I see
So blow a kiss goodbye then close your eyes
Tell me what you see
A lifetime spent inside this dream of mine
Where you are all I see

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle

Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen tytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sill aika ompi voittoisa, mutt tämä maa on ikuinen

There's a place in the North, far, far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fells with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forest walls
Shadows are dancing on the forest walls

Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
It's crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
Morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead, oh yeah

Nightwish - Bye Bye Beautiful


Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead man's face red
With their own blood
They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!

Jacob's ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead Siblings walking the dying earth
Noose around the choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells
(I need to die to feel alive!)

Someday I'll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words
(How blind can you be, don't you see...
That the gambler lost all he does not have)

Sabaton - Race to the Sea


We're keeping the kingdom free

As an archduke falls and the battle horn calls
Our lives would never be the same
We were looking down the barrel of a gun
Now the war has come and the battle has begun
We are desperate and overrun
To the war drum, we'll be marching until it's done

Lead the way, we will follow into the fray
We will hold the line, we will not be led astray

For king and for country
We are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be
The end of the race to the sea
The last piece of Belgium's free
We're keeping a sliver
A cog in the war machine
October of 1914

We'll uphold our independence with our guns

All the way, on to triumph or to judgement day
We will follow and we will not be led astray

See a king and a soldier
Fighting shoulder to shoulder
See a king and a soldier
Fighting shoulder to shoulder
He overruled his commanders
He made a last stand in Flanders
We see our king and a soldier
They're fighting shoulder to shoulder

I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried, but nothing is working
I won’t stop, I won’t say I’ve had enough

Tonight, I break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything

Take yourself to higher places

In Flames - The End


I got a new kind of fear, something you don't wanna view
There's this path that I can see, it leads straight to misery
We can't undo what we have done, just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble, the fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, the outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

What if I say to you: "Let's leave this earth for a while"
A perspective from the hollow and the wheel we can't control

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own

Powerwolf - Nighttime Rebel

In the night of surrender
In the full moonlight and the midnight came
Be the ghostly defender
And of glory be thy name
In the curse of a nightmare
In the end of time, fight a hurricane
Be the lightning and thunder and ignite the final flame
Seven heads, seven demons, seven murders in the sky
Take your fate in your hand now, and so we rise up high
Nighttime rebel, stand alone against the wind
Nighttime rebel, break the holy sin
Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and let begin
Nighttime rebel, all we ride against the dark
Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let begin!
In the ongoing darkness
Where the sky is torn and belief has failed
Be the guide, the pretender, and invoke the dreaded rain
By the hand of an outlaw
By the flaming sword and a headless veil
Like a wolf, like a phantom
To the cross bound nail by nail

Nighttime rebel, before the sin

In the curse after midnight
When inferno born and the mask unveiled
Be the last man unbroken, and in light the one to fade
Nighttime rebel, all we ride against the dark
Nighttime rebel, bear a holy heart
Nighttime rebel, summon in the dawn and let begin
Nighttime rebel, pray and fight against the world

Nighttime rebel, wake up in the night and bring the sin

Metallica - Welcome Home (Sanitarium)


Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?

Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone


Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Hunter (POL) - O Wolności

Magia wokół Nas
Trwa i czeka
W słońcu, oczach gwiazd
Wciąż urzeka
Ciemność zmieni w blask
Daje siłę
Spełnić swoje sny
Te, z dziecięcych lat
Tak zadziwić świat
Życie płynie w Nas
Tylko chwilę
Sam wybierasz łódź, którą płyniesz
Ciemność zmienia w blask
Da nam siłę
Zanim minie czas
Godnie dożyć lat
Tak zadziwić świat
Rozpal czas - jest wieczny - niech płonie
Zadziw świat - pochyli się w pokłonie
Zmieniaj los - uskrzydli Cię
Zanim czas pokona Nas
Życie płynie w Nas tylko chwilę
Sam wybierasz los
Wtedy żyjesz
Ciemność zmieniaj w blask
Da Ci siłę
Zmienić wtedy świat
Choć na chwilę
W raj
Taki miał być plan

Rise Against - The First Drop


I'm calling out
Only echoes respond
But I scream 'til my voice is gone
Crouching in corners and hiding your face
I'm sick and tired of playing your games
I'm not alone
I stand amongst the voiceless
Millions in the unforgiving sun
Here arm-in-arm
We parade these streets
And sing our songs (and sing our songs)

We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)

Unknowing, we lie and wait for the rain
To wash away what they have made
Face down in the dirt with your foot on my back
In the distance I hear thunder crack
Come on, stand up!
This system of power and privilege is about to come to an end
Here come the clouds
The first drop is falling down (falling down)

Our futures burn in red horizons
Ashes scattered in winds of change
Casualty numbers are rising
Now it's time to raise the stakes
We're meant for something more than living
Just to put food on our plates
I can't help but wonder
Why should we participate?

Halestorm - I Am the Fire


Am I brave enough?
Am I strong enough?
To follow the desire
That burns from within
To push away my fear
To stand where I'm afraid
I am through with this
Cuz I am more than this
I promise to myself
Alone and no one else
My flame is rising higher

I am the fire
I am burning brighter
Roaring like a storm
And I am the one I've been waiting for
Screaming like a siren
Alive and burning brighter
I am the fire

I've been sacrificed
My heart's been cauterized
Hanging on to hope
Shackled by the ghost
Of what I once believed
That I could never be
What’s right in front of me

Drachen aus Holz und Segeln
Krieger, wild und verwegen
Walhall wartet auf jeden Mann
Nur wer stirbt auf dem Schlachtfeld
Die Axt fest in der Hand hält
Doch was wenn man nicht sterben kann?
Auf in den Tod
Mit dem Drachenboot
Auf in die stählerne See
Und wir fahren übers Meer
Reiht euch ein in unser Heer
Auf in die Gischt
Mit dem Drachenschiff
Auf in die blutige See
Und das Meer verfärbt sich rot
Unser Segel bringt den Tod

Soaked in red for what she said

Linkin Park - In the End


It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you

My heart so bittersweet
It's coming alive 'cause it's so alive to pain
For good I'll let it bleed
Knowing that somewhere in time you'll feel the same

But should it bleed in vain
Shall all of my sadness be what I am to face
Until the end of days

I'm a million lightyears away from you
Saved a million dried tears just for you
How I only wished that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears away from you
Ohh, ohh, oh (I'm hearing you crying my name)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Can you take the sorrow from me)
Ohh, ohh, oh (Or will it be all we're to see)

Until another dawn

So hurry up, rearm and refuel
But through the bomber’s damaged airframe
See wounded men, scared to their bone

Look to the right and then look again
And see the enemy in the eye
No bullets fly, spared by his mercy
Escorted out, out of harms way

Fly, fighting fair, it’s the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Honour in the skies
B17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the cross he deserved

He risked his life two times that day
To save an unknown enemy
Escort to safety, out of the killzone
A short salute, then departed

Disturbed - The Vengeful One


He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

Alestorm - Shipwrecked


It's three years to the very day
Since a pirate captain said to me
"Hey lad, come join our crew
Adventure and glory waits for you!"
I took his words as gold
Set sail for quests untold
With a bottle of rum in my hand
I dreamed of wealth and foreign lands!

Hey! You're banjaxed!
Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island, lost at sea!
Shipwrecked, you'll cease to be!
Hey! You're banjaxed!
Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island, lost at sea!
Shipwrecked, your destiny!

On the sixteenth night at sea
In the depths of toil and misery
We struck a hidden reef
And our ship began to sink beneath
I grabbed some drifting wood
And held on as long as I could
'Til I landed on a desert isle
Now stuck here 'til the day I die!

Temperance - Pure Life Unfolds


A night without the moon
A light that faded in the dark
There was no end...
Surrounded by those voices

They whispered hopes
They screamed my thoughts
And while the rain fell I felt alone
Then silence came
And someone called my name

"Promise me you will stay
Until the end of this life
I'll be waiting for you"

I won't run away, I won't let you down, hold me
Take me with you, far from this world
We'll be one with our lovе, one with our fate

Dark Tranquillity - Misery's Crown


All has now been broken on streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion, I build my fences high
If there was something out there, I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons not to care

Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me!
Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me!
Wear misery's crown

As always in these matters, you broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given to revel in your mess
I gave up all for nothing, I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons never to share again

This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins

Don't bring it, don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me!
Don't bring it, don't bring it

Eluveitie - From Darkness

Is it not ironic
How your favorite dread
Is the matrix in which you were formed?
The unfathomable dark of a realm arcane
And burrowed far below
The grain sprouts deep beneath the soil
Where sunlight will never, ever, ever reach
Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul
The darkness of night goes out
When dawn befalls in the time
Between the times
And the grain in the soil, buried deep
Shall not bear fruit unless it dies
In the dark of Antumnos
The Awen waves and life is conceived
Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul
You might also likeThe day is born from the night
In the three night of Samon, the year is born
So the song has been sung, let him hear it, who will
Is it not ironic
How you cling so hard to all evidence of all there is
As you maintain your unbroken urge
To explain what you can't?
The child grows in its mother's womb
Enshrouded and concealed
Behold, from darkness we come
That shelter where all life is formed
Ascend, to darkness, we sail
Eternal refuge of the soul

Livin' with snakes, feedin’ the hate, kill the betrayal
Shedding of skin, bitter within, cower in shame
Venomous tongue, blacken the lungs, inducing the pain
Inducing the pain, with constant pushing, provoking reactions

Bring out the knives to cut and divide
Another scar for memories
Bring out the knives to cut and divide
Let 'em breathe, watch 'em burn in the fire

Oh your sweet little lies
Oh your sweet little lies
I can hear when I hold you close to me
When I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
What I see is an only lonely void
And I can see hell in your eyes

'Cause you're drowning inside
Those fake tears that you cried
As I claw my way from your tragedy
Emptiness is your bride
Arrogance is your pride

And you won't pull me down to die

Stuck in this prison with a brother I loved
Stuck in this prison with the memories of...
Another time, when music's all that we had
Bonded by anger and addictions, so glad
Always together but no words are spoken
This is the sound of a friendship broken
Trapped and climbing up the walls
How the fuck do I get out of these pitfalls?

Game over

Dreaming of choking someone I used to know
Strangling the negativity that they sow
Resent has now become the face in the mask
That plays upon a bitter two-man cast
Go find somebody else to blame your problems
Trying to fuck me, because you can't solve them
Stop! You never gave a shit
We almost fucking quit, because how much you hated it

 
For as long as you're alive
I'll curse your worthless name

On the day
On the day of your demise
Unburied and left for the flies
Believe me that I will piss upon your grave
Forgiveness may greet me on someday
But I'll never forget all this pain
Let there be no mistake
This is not a game!
Oh your sweet little lies

Ablaze the spark beyond the stars
Its gleaming wings will cut their way
Through the silent paths of space
Planets whirl, suns are lit
Mountains fly, stars are dimmed

Fly the silent prince electors

Bleach the skeletons of kings
Their skulls of sugar sickly sweet
Their bones piled up on the shore
On bed of mottled rocks
Amid flowers cold as ice

Crawls inside the chosen skull

They have forced me to conform
I will tear down
The holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise
Fueling flames of violent rage
I will be their world's demise

But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate
It burns me deep inside
And still it is, the only thing
Keeping me alive
Dark ambition within my heart
And its aching to break free

The giant lives in me

One life, one chance
All ephemeral
Ephemeral

Der Schein wird uns nicht trügen
Ein letztes Wort
Und wag es nicht zu lügen

Treue Seele, falscher Hund
Die Wahrheit fliegt aus deinem Mund
Jetzt stehst du da
Den Strick um deinen Hals gefasst
Und du denkst nach
Was hast du falsch gemacht?
Tränen fallen vom gesicht
Wenn du in den Spiegel blickst
Siehst du wer dein Henker ist
Dein Leben hängt in deiner Hand

Ensiferum - Victory Song

The plan of invasion an evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches, to slave them all
To make them kneel for a new god
The guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We re outnumbered
But our destiny is to win!
Fight! With the rage of a bear!
Defend! Our homeland!
Crush! Every enemy!
And seal our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Moni jää heitä kaipaamaan
Jälkipolville jää maa rauhaisa
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan

In the name of Ànu
In the presence divine
We pledge our blood to be shed in war

We're lurching in a bloodsoaked
Dystopian dream
Sleepwalking towards the yawning abyss
The throne of lies touts iniquity as good
This is martial law
The final battle has begun
You might also like
We're black-wholed in a synthetical phantom neverland
Latch locked out of the presence of the gods
In a world of nothing but mirrors and smoke
We were walking the line
And swallowed sainted truths

But we're uprising
We're awakening
We are change
The change to come

Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
As above so below

Hark!
The avengers have pulled
He cold kneel from nethersleep
Awoke the astray
Deadlocked the rack rat race of the enslaved
This is martial law
The rebellion has begun

For we are flood
We are fire
We're the voice of the gods
We are one
We are legion
We are rebellion
We are change
The change to come

Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
As above so below
Thy kingdom come
Ànu ascend the throne
Thy will be done
Life will conquer and reign beyond

In Flames - State of Slow Decay


It is my reflection
But I know it's not me
I am becoming something else
I feel the weight of the key

This place is falling apart
There's no way back
Passing through the gates
A new shadow will reveal itself

The stories have run their course
None of them make sense
We are all someone else's fool
Buried in our own debris
We'll destroy the things you know
Destroy yoursеlf in shame
Before tomorrow comеs
Destroy everything


Faith alone won't sustain
We're in a state of slow decay
I hear, forgive, and forget
But I see there's no way

Seen it through the accolades
It all should be a great success

Buried in our own debris
We'll destroy the things you know
Destroy yourself in shame
Before tomorrow comes
Destroy everything

Faith alone won't sustain

I hear, forgive, and forget
But I see there's no way

The Agonist - Panophobia


Keep out the intruders
Put the drawbridge up
The enemy has ransacked
What we had just rebuilt
Now the garden lies
In serene symmetry and severe color theory

Roots slowly poisoning
Through strategic seeds planted inside
We're much safer self-preserved
Let the Dead Sea rise
No, the watchdogs aren't robots
They can't defend against their lures
Doors that weld shut behind you
And books that fly like birds

Crushed by backpacks filled with ammo
Luggage carts distract the defense
And the troops sneak in undetected
Charades begin, start the pretense
Obsessive thought in royal chambers
Invites Trojan warriors in
Little exceptions seem so harmless
Little victories, little wins
You might also like
And now why has the plan failed?
We sit here aimless once again
With all units deployed fully
How is it we let him in?
All the corporals agreed:
Zero-tolerance enforced
But as cold as doorknobs were
I somehow still opened the doors

Each battle lost is a mile gained in this terminal timeline
We all fear the last few inches but they're so far out, we're blind

Each battle lost

A dysfunctional team, we are
No one following the rules
Yes I'll do my best to protect you
But your disobedience intrudes

Skeletons escape the flesh
Like ants through tightly clenched fists
This time impeach the tyrant
What a contradictory statement
Suicidal self-preservationist
Although logic understands
Prison chambers still exist
Chambers east and west conspiring
Neighbors north and south unite
With the four working against me
I'm powerless and losing sight

Each battle lost is a mile gained on this terminal timeline
We all fear the last few inches but they're so far out, we're blind

This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
Immunity gets sick
This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
Taken down, brick by brick
This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
This is the last conflict
Each battle lost
Each battle lost

The Agonist - Danse Macabre

Fools, out of desperation
Cursed to repeat this ancient hand
While all their friendly gestures
Are just a part of your grand plan
No cause for celebration
Your self-destruction lies ahead
Weakened, frigid from the terror
No absolution shall be fed
It's time to play with fire
Chase the visions from the past
And never stop till the very end
From the womb and through life
We're born and bred just to die
Can we redeem for our crimes?
Tangled and swollen in lies
OBEY!
You are a servant to my will
Part of the system
Swear your loyalty to me
Or pay the price
-please can you forgive me?-
You might also likeNo, I won't let you disguise
All the schemes that you tried to untie
There's no way out now from the pit
You must realize
-please won't you release my soul?-
From the womb and through life
We're born and bred just to die
Can we redeem for our crimes?
Tangled and swollen in lies
It's time to play with fire
Chase the visions from the past
And never stop till the very end
From the womb and through life
We're born and bred just to die
Can we redeem for our crimes?
Tangled and swollen in lies
From the womb and through life
We're born and bred just to die
Can we redeem for our crimes?
Tangled and swollen in lies

In this hole, that is me

In this hole thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Reverend, reverend
Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
No revenge beneath me
Lost within my plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery


The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your

Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold
You might also like
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those complex years I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried
And spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away


Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now, I shall reign in blood

Testament - More Than Meets the Eye

Life in a world untold, question the unknown
This prison captures me, my cell is all I know
I thought I knew it all, stubborn in my ways
My sentence has begun, my future's what I waste
Next chapter of my life, filled with violent scenes
I stay awake at night hiding from my dreams
The voices haunting me, driving me insane
Can't seem to get away, they're calling out my name
I feel I am slipping
Are they out to get me?
My life is upside down
More than meets the eye

For now, I am in control, choosing my own fate
And now I sleep at night because I'm not afraid
The demons haunting me, I chased them all away
I've conquered all my fears, my destiny awaits
I'm no longer slipping (I'm not slipping away)
No one is out to get me (No one will get in my way)
No longer upside down (I've turned my life around)
More than meets the eye

Testament - Electric Crown


Here we go, the people show
Victims of tomorrow
The way it goes, it never shows
Emptiness or sorrow
There is nothing left inside
Nothing left to cry for
So I justify my crimes
Things that I must die for

So alone, away it goes
The life that you have wasted
You never know where it might go
The sweet success you've tasted
Tested by a bitter frown
Knowing I must die for
Can't confide to all the lies
No one to inquire
As I wander, change of seasons
As I realise that I'll soon be there
I'll let you know, the reapers show
Makes you beg or borrow
He comes to see the tragedy
His fate he will not follow
Wearing your electric crown
The preacher starts to pray
Shiver as the lights go down
Heed these words I say
You might also likeAs I wander, change of seasons
I can't ponder, got my reasons
As I realise I don't care
All I know is that I'll soon be there

Now it's done, the time has come
The people stand in silence
Another dawn has come and gone
His fate has been decided
There is no one left inside
A brain without mind
Traces of a bitter man
Are all that you will find
As I wander, change of seasons
I can't ponder, got my reasons
As I realise I don't care
All I know is, that I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there

Shadows glow from the full moonlight
Hear clouds cry, it's so insane
Souls hold on to the key of life
See how it's bleeding from the pain
When will they open their eyes
Stop to face our demise
It's live or die
Who am I?
Face in the sky
Walk with me, my friend to a darkness place
Welcome down to the abyss
Caught between two worlds with no advocate
The legion's army
Holds on to your fate
When will they open their eyes
Stop to face our demise
It's live or die
Who am I?
Face in the sky
Screams from the night
Seems to intensify
As the air sifts silent through
Ghouls crowded in the clouds
On a misty night
Guarding secret
Man has brought to you

Waiting for a ride to take them to the Gate
Await the siren call
More phenobarbital
Pour it down the hatch, ingest it all

Children of the Next Level
They're chillin' with the Devil

A new life for an old life
A new form of religion
The final task will reinforce their faith
Immortality
Is it really worth living?

Break through Heaven's Gate
Freedom from this broken world
This mortal shell they leave
Ride up to the sky

Insomnium - While We Sleep


When your heart gives out and your love collapses
When the hand that never lets go is there no more
When you reap and sow only throe and resentment
When there's no one else but you to blame it for

When all you ever wish for is to go back once more
When all you ever wish for is to change it all
When all you feel is remorse, pain and regret
When you dwell in the past unable to move on

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Build a wall of glass thick and deep
We hear but choose not to listen
And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Still the bridge is enflamed with fire
Leave all the love we had behind

Trivium - Strife


My anxiety's clawing
Out from deep within me
It burns within as my throat
Begins to cauterize
This negativity's leeching
Any shred of composure
Rationale has decayed and left
Me bound in madness

I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

How I yearn for the silence
For an end to the voices
The calamity grows and the
Deafness leads to disarray

Just smoke and flames, a constant roaring battle cry
Run from shadows, watch them burn to the point of no return
We had to cross the line before we ever learned
We can't slow down, can't look back, there's no stopping now (I think the end is coming)
Must escape this mess, but how? (Keep running, keep running)
There's no easy way to get out
Never thought it would be so easy to create our doom
It's a bitter taste, it's all еrased
Death of a world on our consciencе
Go before the storm's upon us
Now don't dwell on hate, this is our fate
Don't you look back, just stay on track

Will we finally find a way to turn back home?
Stand our ground or we'll be dead
Will we live another day?

The totem of the griffin, the totem of the deer
Are tattooed on my skin as they are tattooed on my peers

The shaman, the enare has seen what is to come
The shaking of the ground as the hooves of horses drum

And run or be beheaded or perhaps a weeping slave
I measure a man by the trophies he displays
For no trophies are won by those who flee and run away
The Greek call me a savage, uncivilized and dumb
And still I hold their fate within the drawing of my thumb

And to be a man of wealth within them makes me nothing but appalled

Nekrogoblikon - Powercore

Get out!
Your repugnancy deeply sickens me
You are a failure and I want you to die!
Your dumb look implies that you do not know why
So let me break it down:
You are stifling the power, rotten to the core
Such a massive fail, guess what? You're boring and I've seen this all before
You're a joke and no one's laughing
I'm goin' for baroque and it all comes crashing down
Every time that you try to do something right
You seem to get it oh so wrong
It's almost like a joke
But no one's laughing now
As we reach the final hour
You were never the core of my power
Just a foolish dream and
You have failed me
You're not the powercore
You're not the powercore
You're a fish (fish)
You're so terrible, it's unbearable
You're just a phony, and I want you to explode
Your deplorable brain fills my heart with disdain
Ain't got the time to explain...

But no one's laughing now
As we reach the final hour
You were never the core of my power
Just a foolish dream and
You have failed me
To think I ever trusted you makes me bow my head in shame
Everything has gone to shit and as always you're the only one to blame
Reality trembles at the notion of one so naive
To know I gave you one more chance gives me the creeps
More disappointing than a box of rats on christmas
More worthless than a dumpster filled with pogs (POGS!)
More disgusting than the time I took a bath with lots of slugs
More revolting than a barrel full of ears
You're a failure!
Every time that you try to do something right
You seem to get it oh so wrong
It's almost like a joke
But no one's laughing now
As we reach the final hour

We built this fallen bridge
The very first day we met
Never said I did any better
My heart all over the place
Just a remind of days
Will make it burn both ways
Sure as hell we blew it together
With blood all over the face
Since the day I breached through to you
My breath shall burden yours too
Was it for me to take
Only for you to break
Maybe just another way
You my little parasite
Really just to seek me
Maybe fight to live in me
Or just another day
For you my little paranoid
I've lost my mind
In the final fight
We've passed through the final night
Bestowed by the hope of light

Bloodred Hourglass - Nightmares Are Dreams Too


Right here, right now
Nightmares are dreams too

You know the smartest know they know nothing
Idle hands are the devils play things
So what have you really earned to preach
When I ask you nothing at all
If anything misleads it's truth
But mostly all I know of you
Is the less you speak
The more I listen to

Message of hope that's wrapped in sadness
Returned to sender
Different stories with endless glory

Right here right now
I will leave you far behind
Right here right now
I believe the one inside
Broken trust, it's running on fumes
So feed me with something new
Before this is me against myself
Making space for my new mistakes

It's only lies that I bust in your life
Could you prove me innocent while
It's only life that you chose to disguise
So could you prove me innocent

Doom me, prove me wrong

Cattle Decapitation - The Geocide


Suddenly all of humanity's
Past accomplishments and vanities
Individuals and families
Human bureaucracies
Lost in the calamity
Those who thought this was a fallacy
And those who knew the end was coming

The universe, it always finds a way to purge
The sustainably inappropriate numbers that once surged
Death always wins, his molten torch forever burns
And to the ashes and the ground we are returned
Life exists to infuriate, berate, and subjugate
The hapless mortals shit-birthed on a human-altered planet Earth

Apocalypse
Sudden death of a metropolis
We fucking needed this

Bleed From Within - The End of All We Know


I'm hearing voices, but I'm not seeing progress
Devastate, can't relate
Stay the fuck away from me
We run at nothing till we can't turn back
So we dig our way to the other side
I finally feel like I can breathe again
Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall
I shed my skin once and for all

The light is shifting out of sight but not out of mind

What the light has failed to capture
Is this the end of all we know?
I will not deny the warning signs
This time I will not stand alone

Fall into insanity again and again
Lingering obsessions
Dwell in the shadows below
In this moment there is pain in our eyes
All that we have left, we will die for
I finally feel like I can breathe again
Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall

Let the fires rise
From the ashes we will see the light

I will not deny the warning signs

Blazing ahead, moving on
One last ride, one for the road

Take a few last turns

A bloody sand has now run out
Out of time and out of mind

One for the road, one for the road
One last ride
Standing at the edge
Leaving behind all the rest

Kreator - Hate Über Alles


Never asked to be reborn
Or submit unto their norm
Don't you ever tell me how to live my life
For rebellion I am armed
All my senses are alarmed
Decimate this mental breed that I despise
For this system I can't trust
In these ruins of arrogance
My saviors are destroyers to some

Here I stand with both my hands untied

Hate über alles

Live to win, not follow, bow
I'm an entity on a human journey
For my Reich's not of this world
I reject the empires gold
For the purest liberty, my heart is yearning
No distraction, no regrets
Slay the guardians at the gates
For this cult was never meant to compromise

Insomnium - Lilian


Maiden at the lake shore
Sunlight's dance on waves
Lilies and heathers
Sweet scent in the air
And her hair is auburn
Like the bark on pine
In the wind it flutters
Blazing in summer breeze

I dare not even raise my voice
I dare not even move or breathe
I see a bare white shoulder
A dark mark on her back
Shape like a moth's wing
Sign of the nightly paths

I drift in twilight
I stray into the dusk
I'm lost in her eyes
I drift in twilight
I stray into the dusk
I'm lost in her eyes

I'm lost in her eyes
I drift in twilight

Before the Dawn - Deadsong


The container of my soul was severed from my shell
At birth I was stigmatized by fires of hell
This hollow space inside is growing still
It's going for the kill
Beneath the blood red sky the song was born
The sky was bleeding when I sang her the deadsong

By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death
Was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame

She slept under my wing
A cold embrace
Death's loyal servant now filled with pain
Forever haunted by her angelic face

By my burning cradle
The lullaby of death
Was sung by dark angels
The daughters of flame

Countless lightyears far away, at the galactic core
A hidden pristine onyx sphere of inescapable magnitude
Four million stellar masses, condensed in singularity
The quantum breakdown of the thermodynamic law
Four billion years have passed and all we truly know is this
That astral deities still dwell within the deep abyss
Beyond the Schwarzschild radius, existence does not cease
The event horizon is no barrier to immortality
Forbidden ancient scrolls of Einsteinеan elucidation speak of unimaginable horrors within!
Four billion yеars have passed and all we truly know is this
That astral deities still dwell within the deep abyss
Beyond the universal law of stellar entropy
Extra-galactic masters of mortal reality
The path we chose, must soon be judged in kind
A quantum flux, until the end of time
A black sun rising, the eldritch moon
Behold! Arise! Macrocosmic doom!
And from the Stygian abyss of quantum singularity came forth beings of such terrible and immense power
Wielding the subatomic strands of the firmament as tendrils of entropic destruction, to reap the harvest of the entire multiverse!

For countless aeons we have crossed the nighted void of the astral firmament, in search of the non-euclidean hypercrystal of Xantar'ax... and now, our voyage will finally end, in Markarian-231!
A quasar in a distant Seyfert galaxy
(A crystal at its dying heart)
3-D projection, of a quintic manifold
(Dimensions unknown to mankind)
Eight white dwarfs orbiting the stellar core
(Nine body problem - trivial to me!)
Accelerating towards its cosmic doom
Eternal Doom!
This ancient craft has been my tomb for all my life
(A tomb for time immemorial)
In stasis I have travelled, waiting...
(Waiting for the system to align)
No longer tangible as human in my form
(Solar flarеs tearing at my flesh)
Accelеrating toward my cosmic doom
My Doom!
Wreathed in macrocosmic starfire
Subharmonic strands ablaze
Behold celestial convergence
Of nine stars in Markarian-231

And though the twin orbs of Thyraxia illuminate the heavens no longer

I shall wield the crystal, bring swift justice to the rogue gods, and hold dominion over the entire cosmos...
I shall reign over all existence as it's ineffable God... forever!
ASTRAIOS! I call you to life!
From endless inertia, beyond infinite night (rejoin the stars)
All potentiality at once, phase-space paths complete
The ennead of giants aflame forge gates through all consuming heat
Predominance is imminent, my matchless grandeur burning for all time
Wreathed in macrocosmic starfire
Subharmonic strands ablaze
Behold celestial convergence
Of nine stars in Markarian-231
Behold, the ephemeral dance of cosmic infinity, painted across the endless canvas of the multiverse! It is finally mine! I wield the non-euclidean hypercrystal of Xantar'ax!

And I see the same faces again
Of the people who tell me
What I should do, and where I should go
The same advices to compromise
I'd rather break their necks right now !!!
With empty words, spilled over tears
Don't take me down

You want take me, what I have done
I knot it
I saw it
So you can give me nothing more

Ad Infinitum (CHE) - I Am the Storm


Through my eyes, just a shadow (just a shadow)
Standing there at the window
You're the ghost behind, haunting me
You're the wall of ice, but I'll burn you down

Nothing will stand in my way
As I embrace my destiny
No, your arrows will not bring me down
You're just a noise, a whisper in the night
My heart beats harder than the thunder (harder than the thunder)
From fire, I'm born
I am the storm

Dark grey clouds all around
Ice cold winds, but I am just fine
Oh, I see the dreamscapes, leave the cries behind
I can kill my demons with a smile

Nothing will stand in my way
As I embrace my destiny
No, your arrows will not bring me down
You're just a noise, a whisper in the night
My heart beats harder than the thunder (harder than the thunder)
From fire, I'm born
I am the storm
You might also like
I've been there before
I felt the fear, I feared the cold
Imprisoned in lies
Illusions of flames, only in my mind
I opened my eyes
To a brand new world
A place where darkness
Is meant to show your inner light

Nothing will stand in my way
As I embrace my destiny
No, your arrows will not bring me down
You're just a noise, a whisper in the night
My heart beats harder than the thunder (harder than the thunder)
From fire, I'm born
I am the storm
I am the storm

The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya

Wake up, got another day to get
Through now, got another man to see
Gotta call him on the telephone way-o
Gotta find a piece of paper
Sit down, got another letter to write
Think hard, gotta get a letter just right
Little ringing on the telephone, whoa no

Bad Wolves - Zombie


Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dying

I see the darkness in your eyes
I feel the spark of life go weaker
In your restless soul
I can hear your fading cries
A relentless wail now going on and on

When the tears are in your eyes
You sing a drunken lullaby
And the weight of the world
Comes crashing on your spine
Now remember what's inside
The warmth that made you smile
And rise up high
Towards the golden sky
Your Eden
Your Eden

Blood is gushing from your palms
Your feeble heart is breaking
Your soul reduced to ash
Pictures racing through your mind
Dearest memories from not so long ago

Battle Beast - Familiar Hell

I've been in heaven and underground
Maybe now I'm just lost and found
Living in a false fantasy
Safe from ruthless reality
I'm stranded in this paradise
So tell me what to sacrifice
To get out of this tragedy
Out of insanity
Is familiar hell
Better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
Behind every choice
Living under a spell
24/7
Lost in confusion
Ignorance and illusion
I want out of insanity
I suffer like a hollow soul
Trying to be complete and whole
I'm dreaming like a madman
About things I don't understand
I'm stranded in this paradise
So tell me what to sacrifice
To get out of this tragedy
Out of insanity

Is familiar hell

Listen to me
What if
We only believe that we can choose our reality?
What if
The truth we know is just a profitable fantasy?
If we view the world with closed eyes
And only look after ourselves
It's easy to swallow all the juicy lies
But who the fuck is gonna clean up the mess?
So I ask you one more time
Is familiar hell
Better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
Behind every choice
Living under a spell

Is familiar hell
Better than unknown heaven?
Only one voice
Behind every choice
Living under a spell

Blindside - Pitiful


As I recall when my stomach turned
And I was hiding away from myself
Away from you
Like nothing though something was terribly wrong
And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time, night time
The right moment for you to look away
Though you never did I pretended for a while
So I could walk where I don't belong

I remember every word you said
Come back in time come back
And I remember I would soon be dead
Pitiful, so pitiful

But I know, as they hammered those nails, into your beautiful hands
Your eyes they tried to search for mine
But I look away
Now your eyes are the only thing that can save me
I'm still afraid of them piercing
You're breaking into my prison
Just pretended for a while
I still decided to walk away

Then I found the good fight the best fight
Redirected rage against the dying of the light
Set my sights, fire bars at will shot to kill, never gonna stand still

Round and round, inside I break

And I can hear voices from three blocks away
Am I insane?

Doctor, doctor, what's happening to me?
Doctor, doctor, can't you set me free?
I know my savior of my behavior
Before I know it, I'll be six feet underground
Can you keep me sane?
Can you stop the pain?
I'm lost in madness, I'll be six feet underground

My lips are lying around

Turning me into what had been lost

I'll never tell them that you left me on the side of the road, but
Hard to believe that I was waking up next to you before
You slammed your fist against the wall and threw us out the door
Thought you could bury us inside another empty rumor

I can't be the only one you've hurt
Maybe you'll get what you deserve

If they find out you're the villain so what
Serves you right
Serves you right
You only play the hero for the attention
'Cause it's serves you right
Does it serve you right?
When your darkness comes to light
'Cause you've told one too many lies
The truth won't hide
It'll serve you right

I wouldn't wish you on my own worst enemy

When your darkness comes to light
'Cause you've told one too many lies
The truth won't hide
It'll serve you right
And I'll be here patiently waiting
Wishing and hoping and praying
That I'll have a front row seat
When you sow what you reap

Elvenking - Elvenlegions


Born under red skies, dungeons and darkness
Six bards - one of a kind
Wohoe! (Wohoe!) We dance on the witches' night
Music and spirit for the outcast brotherhood
Six bards - one for all
Wohoe! (Wohoe!) The Elven family

Fire! Round the flames we dance to our reels
Pronouncing our rites (Legions!)
Scream out words of heathenry and magic

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots
We light the fires of purity, minority
We are the Elvenlegions on the rise!
Legions on the rise

Heathenreel and witchcraft, poems and legends
Six torches warm in the night
We are (We are) casting a spell on you
From blood we come and as stone we cease
The tree of our eternal life
We are (We are) The Elven dynasty
You might also like
Fire, we've been cast in the mouth of fire
Dead fallen heroes legions
Like a modern Prometheus we rise from the ashes

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots
We light the fires of purity, minority
We are the Elvenlegions on the rise!

We are the off-keys, we gather in secrecy
Dormant apparently, ready to mind (ready to mind)
We're as one with the earth
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
We have embraced the ways of purity
Summoned the One and mastered the runes
We are ready to strike!

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets

We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say, in heaven, love comes first
Who make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
When the night falls down
I wait for you
And you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids
On the street outside
When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say, in heaven, love comes first
Who make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
When I feel alone
I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me

Elvenking - Silverseal

On that summer's eve
We have made a deal
Endorsed by a seal
We'd stay together
Pain and fears to allay
On that very day
I trusted your prayers
Lightweight as feathers
We are destined to ache
Astray far away
Towards the lands of the enemies
Way to remedy the Silverseal
The light of day far away
Is a guidance to our legacy
Break the Silverseal
Look inside my frost
Mirrors of the lost
Souls with no remorse
I thought you were worlds apart
A pain that's hard to care
We will never dare
To defy that flare
It shined and now fades – all dark
You might also likeWe are destined to ache
Astray far away
Towards the lands of the enemies
Way to remedy the Silverseal
The light of day far away
Is a guidance to our legacy
Break the Silverseal
We will all waste away
You will be betrayed
Destined to stay alone – we are destined to ache
In the runes I can read your demons
I can see the haze that fill your voids
I can see the stern that wraps you up
Astray far away
Towards the lands of the enemies
Way to remedy the Silverseal
The light of day far away
Is a guidance to our legacy
Break the Silverseal
Astray far away
Towards the lands of the enemies
Way to remedy the Silverseal
The light of day far away
Is a guidance to our legacy
Break the Silverseal

Fferyllt - Call of the Wild

1 ContributorCall of the Wild LyricsI will follow the wind blowing softly
Over the tallest trees, touching leaves
Twisting playing with your hair passionately
Leaving all your wishes there in the past
I will follow the sun, its warm rays are
Falling on the icy ground letting bright days
Come to the epoch where old world stories
Are going quiet to memory
Arise, and follow me, set free from earthly leash
Fly with the tameless wind, into serenity
To the eternity, where dreams come true
For me and you, where time is but an empty word
I will follow the rain, warm drops falling
Down on the frosty stones and reviving
Greenish silver mountain cover
Walking up the drowsing waterfall, and ice disappears
I will follow the moon howling wolves will
Tell me that I here belong place that's full of
Wilderness, gives me hidden powers, feeling that my
Inner beast found his home
Arise, and follow me, set free from earthly leash
Fly with the tameless wind, into serenity
To the eternity, where dreams come true
For me and you, where time is but an empty wordYou might also like

Frozen Crown - I Am the Tyrant


Born from the depths in the highlands
Between the daughters of wind
And the sons of the sea
Raised by the wolves and their hunger
I knew the world's bloody end
Before the struggle began

Hail to the beast, to the pain that it brings
To the ashes it leaves after coming unseen
Over the hills we were carried by the wind
For the glory we will rise up once again

I am the tyrant, crowned and fallen
Before the age of men
(Beneath the dark)
I am the hunter, bound and rotten
Beyond the gates of hell

Far from my land
Wild gales whisper my name
Buried under the sands
Lay the wasted remains
Of the kingdom we claimed
You might also like
I am the tyrant, crowned and fallen
Before the age of men

As the wicked desire unleashes
Thorns, entwined on my grave
Sealed up forever my throne, death after death

I am the tyrant, crowned and fallen
Before the age of men
(Beneath the dark)
I am the hunter, bound and rotten
Beyond the gates of hell

A tempest of fire and ice

Remember the frozen tears
Turning each second to years

Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black dogs
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me

That's right
Deliver it to my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate

Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate

Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me

That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now

Wait, I'm coming undone
Irate, I'm coming undone
Too late, I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate
And soon, I anticipate
I'm coming undone
What looks so strong, so delicate
I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show ya, so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down, and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Oh, word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it on the way
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music, we can use it, be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Nonpoint - That Day


It wasn't just the words that were thrown around
The sound that they made when they hit the ground runnin'
You were out for blood, and I was still tapped out from the battle before
I remember the smell in the room, it was a bad tattoo, like cheap perfume
Rainin' with the windows open, just hopin' that the sun breaks through for a moment
Days turn week, months into a year
I gotta bring up all the things that are harder to hear
Then the same ole pat on the back
It'll all work out, and everything'll be alright

Losin' sight of reality, while losin' the fight to try to forget
All I have are the memories of every single word you said
Every single word you said

I remember that day everything changed
I remember that day. That image never fades away
I remember that day somethin' died inside of me
I remember that day that everything changed

It wasn't just a senseless situation
No sense of making somethin' out of nothin' now
I know it would be pointless at this point in time to point out any problems now
Are you forgettin' the rumors and reputation don't help your situation?
When all you have to show the world is how you act out your problems like a little girl
And if memory serves me right, you were servin' up nothin', but a plate of lies
And it was covered in flies
Rotten from the inside out
Excuse my reluctance to put it in my mouth

You say I have a problem now?
I say, "There is no way for us out of here!"

Hit me, kick me
You can never get me
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, strike me
Don't you wrong or right me
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Northern Kings - We Don't Need Another Hero

1 ContributorWe Don’t Need Another Hero Lyrics
Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear 'till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there:
Love and compassion (Love and compassion)
Their day is coming (Their day is coming)
All else are castles built in the air (air)

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear 'till nothing else remains
You might also like
All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

So, what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

We are the children
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
(Nothing else remains) The last generation
(We don't need another hero) Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage (Out from the wreckage)

Papa Roach - Between Angels and Insects


There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just want to be heard
Loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man
Tell them what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind
You can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin'
But a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system
Working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinking about yourself
Start thinking about

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
You might also like
Because everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out It's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never going to fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Money, possessions, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair, clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
The things you own, own you. No!
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possessions, fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession
I don't need that shit

Papa Roach - Last Resort


Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself, and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

I'm runnin' and I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I can't go on living this way

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight

Tarot - Ashes to the Stars

Jump into madness awaiting at the seams
Of all reality and mind
Through the wound torn in space and time
I blink, centuries unwind
Hear the voice of the suns
The wind at your face
The rage of the storm
Spread my ashes to the stars
Join the raw chaos at heart
Spread my ashes to the stars
Fall forever in the dark
Neurons backfire in the onrush of data
Endless orgasm supreme
Joining of flesh with fiber and steel
Lovers, the ghost and machine
Hear the voice of the suns
The wind at your face
The rage of the storm
Spread my ashes to the stars
Join the raw chaos at heart
Spread my ashes to the stars
Fall forever in the dark
(Zac's Solo)
Moving astral in the veins of acid
Across the silvery skin
Feeding on miracles, clutching like a spider
The ends of space from within
You might also likeScreamswept blackness, that is my head
Dreams all that there will be
Breeding myself back from the dead
For all this eternity

The rage of the storm

Join the raw chaos at heart
Spread my ashes to the stars
Fall forever in the dark

Tarot - I Walk Forever

Did I leave in time for the words to rhyme
For her heart to wait ever longing?
I am not the one, neither just for one
I am made of hopes left unfulfilled
I walk forever
'Til my road winds up into the sky
Never needed to learn how to fly
I walk forever
'Til my left is hazed into the right
Getting lost in the shadows of white
I walk forever
Drawing breath somewhere from the strands of her hair
I am shaken by the pain of freedom
When the nights grow still, she will climb this hill
Silence only on the road beyond
I walk forever
'Til my road winds up into the sky
Never needed to learn how to fly
I walk forever
'Til my left is hazed into the right
Getting lost in the shadows of white
I walk forever
I walk forever

'Til my road winds up into the sky

Mono Inc. - Welcome to Hell


Too much sorrow on the oceans
Too much fighting on the streets
Too much roorback in the headlines
Too much hate and evil deeds
Did you think you'd get off easy?
Did you think we would connive?
All those dark manipulations
You accomplished in your life

Time to take responsibility
For the games that you misplay
You believe in immortality
And we believe in judgment day

Welcome to Hell, this is the end
The flame of relief
Welcome to Hell, this is the end
Don't succumb to grief
Go on, lie, and go on, blow your horn
Who sows the wind shall reap the storm

Too much cheating and corruption
Degradation and deceit
Too much guile, too many victims
No concerns for those in need
Did you think that you could slip through?
Did you think that we would blench?
We are weak but we are many and we're seeking for revenge

Turisas - Battle Metal


A name uttered with fear
No smile, no tears
They'll crush your skull with a blow
And pile them in a row

The heart of Turisas was forged by four winds
In a smithy high up in the skies
On an anvil of honour, with a hammer of blood
The Four Winds pounded

Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!
As the battle rages the dearest to you
You hold in your hand -
And stick in their lungs!
Battle, Battle Metal!
Battle, Battle Metal!

An iron gaze of a hawk
Out of sight they stalk
Their arrows cut the air as they fly
Death from the sky
Thunder in their eyes
A riding demise
Storming over the men on the field
Breaking their shield

Take this sign into your heart and be brave

Soldiers from all the edges of the world

To an army, united
Four winds will guide us
The Heart of Turisas will lead our way
Our drums echo: Forward march
Our horns cry for victory

Boldest of them all
They've answered the call
Their arms were strenghtened by the work of their swords
They'll march till they fall

The heart of Turisas was forged by four winds
In a smithy high up in the skies
On an anvil of honour, with a hammer of blood

Turisas - Stand Up and Fight


The pouring rain
Sticks my hair to my face
An empty gaze
Is all that I have left
The stars that once led my way
Have dimmed
The sky turned gray
The path once so clear
Faded away
Blessed are the days
When life is intent and clear
No falter or doubt
I know the way
They are the days I hope
That I never stepped on this road
The spark I once had
Seems to have died

Stand up and fight!
Stand up and look into the light
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight!
Stand up and see the sky turn bright
Fight for a better day
You might also like
What a relief it would be
To end this all
How easy to fly the white flag
And give up
But would I run today
Just to die another day?
Give up now and every fight
Has been in vain

Stand up and fight!
Stand up and look into the light
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight!
Stand up and see the sky turn bright
Fight for a better day
Get up! You've made it this far!
No loser you are!
One more time!
One more try!
The pouring rain
Sticks my hair to my face...
Stand up and fight!
Stand up and look into the light
Pushing the clouds away
Stand up and fight!
Stand up and see the sky turn bright
Fight for a better day

Stand up and fight!
Stand up and fight!

Contemplate your brand new saviour
For those of you who live in misery
Look to the sky and embrace your inner fear
Fear... The sense of isolation
The reason of it all
The weakest generation
The dark of the day
The lies an the illusions
The end of what we know
The fading generation
The dark of the day

Despise the condemned
See a face and mark it as inferior
Constantly asking for attention
Wearing an invisible crown
Ignore the diseased
Vermins of society
Rejected as the whole world
Buried beneath the ground
This is the day of rejection
The is the pain we're going through
This is the end of life as we know
This is the end of all the scars
This is the only chance to face the bright tyrant eyes
Remove ignorance
Accept what cannot be changed
Those who are forgotten
Those who won't remain

Point the finger to yourself
We are rejected

Blind Guardian - Nightfall


No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost, it cannot be undone
They're wasted and gone"

"Save me your speeches, I know"
(They blinded us all)
"What you want, you will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in is gone forever more"
Like sorrowful seagulls they sang
Lost in the deep shades the misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone, come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown

Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain

Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
You might also like
How long shall we mourn in the dark
The bliss and the beauty will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be
But even in silence, I heard the words
An oath we shall swear by the name of the one till the world's end
(Just wondering how I can still hear these voices inside)
It cannot be broken
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger, aflamed our hearts
Full of hate, full of pride
Oh we screamed for revenge

Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony

"Vala he is, that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But freely you came and
You freely shall depart)
Never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord
You better not trust him
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind
And finally you may follow me
Farewell", he said

Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony

Back to where it all began
Back to where it all began

Blind Guardian - Twilight of the Gods


How've they dared to be
Such misguided creatures
How've they dared to be
Of such evil nature
Spiral up to doors all sealed
No turning back
Red door to Discordia
Steal the stars
Deceive the day
A sign of evil
They're gone with a final warning

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
You might also likeThe damage's done
The king is gone

There is war
Wherever I'll roam
Gods will come and
Gods will go
The spinning wheel keeps turning
Now get up
Lay down your ancient faith
We're the chosen ones
Come feel the change
A way
Let me show a new way
When you dare to walk with me
Bow down
And surrender
The old gods
Black or white
To me it's grey
A sign of evil
I hail all these non-believers
Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

Deliver your gods
They shall be slain
I'm their fallen son
Don't be afraid
A way
Let me show a new way
When you're going to walk with me
As one
We're infernal
What's going up
It will come down
We're here to change
There's war in Discordia
Sure as death
We all must fade
A sign of evil
Reach for a new horizon

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse

Watch, watch, the dark book is yearning

Swedish Hitz Goes Metal - The Winner Takes It All

1 ContributorThe Winner Takes It All LyricsI don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The guards may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The losers have to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain
So tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The ushers will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it allYou might also like

Ad Infinitum (CHE) - Animals


(We are animals)

I'm not afraid of the monster in you
I heard the stories and I hope they are true
Adrenaline is calling my name
No hesitation darling, I'm still waiting
And for the first time I will feel alive, alive

Offer me a world of shadows and eternity
We are animals
Hunting for another supper, for another prey
Losing our soul
The love for danger is rushing through my veins
Offer me your world, your thirst for immortality
We are animals

I will unleash the rage, the fury
My primitive and my wildest instincts
Get rid of all the complications
Of human paradoxes, all frustrations
The meaningless is no longer welcome now

Subconsciously, our primitive instincts are puppeteers of the mind
Handcuffed by the rules and limits we applied
WILD! All my senses awaken, I was buried alive
SCREAM! All the hidden desires, I am reborn tonight

Offer me a world of shadows and eternity
Hunting for another supper, for another prey
Losing our soul
The love for danger is rushing through my veins
Offer me your world, your thirst for immortality

Counterfeit - You Can't Rely


Why can't you relax
I'm staring at your faded photographs
And asking why I've wasted all this time
On nothing but an empty fucking lie

God help me 'cause I know I'm overrun
With these fears I've overcome
And it's clear what time has done
Yet I stare blankly at you screaming "Save me!"

My body is broken
The devils arms around me
'Coz these angels, they don't love me,
They want their pound of flesh
Once needed, now rejected
You've heard the same old story
You can't rely on someone else

Give it all you got
I need it 'coz i feel like I've been shot
Between the teeth and nails
And darkest thoughts
There lies an animal behind these scars
Take a look what I've become
Not a lover nor a son
Never needed anyone
And now I feel like I am slowly dying

My body is broken
The devils arms around me
These angels, they don't love me,
They want their pound of flesh
Once needed, now rejected
You've heard the same old story
You can't rely on someone else

My body is broken
My body is broken
My body is broken
My body is broken
My body is broken
The devils arms around me
My body is broken
Oh Jesus
(Someone save me)
My body is broken
The devils arms around me
These angels, they don't love me,
They want their pound of flesh
Once needed, now rejected
You've heard the same old story
You can't rely on someone else
You can't rely on someone else
You can't rely on someone else

Crystal Viper - The Cult

All of us will notice when the time will come
People shouting killing reveling in joy
Beyond good and evil, with laws thrown aside
They will start dim era, human race won't hide
Hypnotizing terror, screams and frantic cry
They will show no mercy, it’s their time to rise
When the ancient spirits will bring raging war
Bloody days of evil, mankind will be gone

Hear their call, loathsome faith
Now it's time of their sway
Their sway
Haunted swamps of madness, hidden from the sun
Unhallowed blasphemies will fall from the sky
Hordes of nasty creatures will be spreading fear
We will take delusion for reality
We will lose horizons over liquid gulfs
Reeling universes in front of our eyes
In this cosmic order, with no place for us
Death is consolation, our only way out

Hear their call, loathsome faith
Now it's time of their sway
Their sway

What happened that awful night?
What happened there, I can't understand
I can remember my cry
Come on! Hurry!
Are you still going down?
Come on! Hurry!
I can hear you're alive
Come on! Hurry!
Now! Before it's too late!
Come back!
Covered by moss, dead cold and gross
Graveyard under the crescent moon
I can still hear in my memory
Voice that was calling my name
Come on! Hurry!
Are you still going down?
Come on! Hurry!
I can hear you're alive
Come on! Hurry!
Now! Before it's too late!
Come back!

Evergrey - Recreation Day

One step at a time
Small progress seems futile
But it's as valuable as life
I'm engaged to longing
With sorrow as the ring
Controlling me, denying me
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day
The beginning of a recreation...
Time heals, but still the mourning reigns
I still breath when the loss reminds me again
I am here
Life is fear
And sorrow's all I know
Am I in debt cause so it seems
But what I owe
I don't know
Devoured by guilt and cursed beyond control
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day
The beginning of a recreation... (x 2)

Dropkick Murphys - Rose Tattoo


The pictures tell the story
This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in its tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over

With pride I wear it to the grave

I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along

You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

Set me on fire
I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I'll find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light

Gloryhammer - The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee


They came with the first light of dawn
Setting their sights on Dundee
Led by the sorcerer Zargothrax
Slaying all people he sees
They ride to war on once noble beasts
Corrupted by wizard spell
The unicorns used to be good
Now they are forced to serve hell

Down from the mountains
And across the river Tay
An army of undead unicorns
Are riding into the fray

Fireballs and lighting are raining from the sky
Chaos and bloodshed while all the people die
In this epic battle begins the final war
Tragedy will strike this day, prepare thee for
The unicorn invasion of Dundee

The townpeople had little hope
They were not ready for war
Fireballs make everybody die
And buildings collapse to the floor
The beautiful princess was raped
And taken to prison with cry
Angus McFife swears a mighty oath
"I will make Zargothrax die!"

They must find a hero
To save its destiny

Chaos and bloodshed while all the people die

Tragedy will strike this day, prepare thee for
The unicorn invasion of Dundee

And an ominous shadow fell over the battlefield. As the evil wizard Zargothrax rode into the once mighty city of Dundee, atop an undead unicorn of war to enthrone himself as its new dark master!

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel
Now it is lost, vengeance shall be his
Angus McFife is his name

Across the wasteland, I ride upon swift steed
Behind me lies the burning ruins of Dundee
No turning back now, my journey lies ahead
I won't give up until the sorcerer is dead

A raging hero with a destiny of steel
With glory overcomes a mighty quest concealed

He is the prince of the land of Fife
Noble and true with a heart of steel

Glenrothes trees will heal the torment in my soul

Grave Digger - Rebellion (The Clans Are Marching)


The clan's are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
Rumours know that rebellion will break out
Bonnie Prince Charles is in the highlands to claim his crown no doubt
He raised his Standard at Glenfinnen calling to our pride
The Jacobites are gathering I'll be at their side
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel is in my hand

The clan's are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find

Defeated the English at the Battle of Prestopans

Nocturnal Rites - Fools Never Die

Trading their lies on the TV-screen
Telling us all what to be
Act like they're gods, egos inflated
Can't believe you'd fail to see
Other lives on the great divide
And hungry you swallow their scheme
Small-minded fools, they're all so conceited
Don't you know they're never quite what they seem
As weird as if a dream
Another fool, one more crossing the line
Won't believe, a mad man leads the blind
So follow the heart and hear them cry
'Cause fools never die
Crawl on your knees for your world to grow
A round of applause and you go
In with the freaks, swallow our poison
Never thought you'd stoop this low
Another fool, one more crossing the line
Won't believe, a mad man leads the blind
So follow the heart and hear them cry

1 ContributorStill Alive LyricsLike a thunder storm it's breaking out
Won't take another blow, and
I'll let you know
I'll never kneel or falter
'cause you are not the only
I'm not crawling back again
I'm still alive
Though I'm old, tired and weary
And I know I'm alive enough
To stand my ground
So there is nothing to revive
I'm still alive
I tried to wash away those filthy lies
Betrayed and lead astray
I just walked away
And in my darkest hour
I still hear you breathing
Well, you won't get the best of me
I'm still alive
Though I'm old, tired and weary
And I know I'm alive enough
To stand my ground
So there is nothing to revive

Dream Theater - Panic Attack



All wound up, on the edge, terrified
Sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
Bouts of fear permeate all I see
Heightening nervousness threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard, warning signs never show
Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane
Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best

Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

Majestica - Rising Tide

1 ContributorRising Tide LyricsWe have heard about it
A tale they say is true
Far away the spring lies waiting for you
We can't all ignore that years go by for me and you
No way to stay young they always say
No younger ladies dare to dance the night away
A fountain far away might bring back the times
Of younger days
Under stars at night across the sea we sail forever more
To the foreign land we go and never die
Lighting strikes when we're approaching to what we've been looking for
Take a drink and then be strong and young with pride
To sail the rising tide
When the deed is done we're heading back
To show the world what we have found
Spinsters waiting we'll bring the action to you
Grey-haired brutes with women's looks is all that we can get
And it leads to anguish
Horror liberate us from our wrongs
Come join our banquet over night with floating ale
With hardship we accept but tomorrow it ends
When we set our sail
You might also likeUnder stars at night across the sea we sail forever more
To the foreign land we go and never die
Lighting strikes when we're approaching to what we've been looking for
Take a drink and then be strong and young with pride
To sail the rising tide
Blind leads the blind tonight
But we stand here together as one
When our quest begins!
We have gone
Far away from home
And we know where to go
But the star shine above brings us hope
Of finding the way!
Under stars at night across the sea we sail forever more
To the foreign land we go and never die
Lighting strikes when we're approaching to what we've been looking for
Take a drink and then be strong and young with pride
Under stars at night across the sea we sail forever more
To the foreign land we go and never die
Lighting strikes when we're approaching to what we've been looking for
Take a drink and then be strong and young with pride
To sail the rising tide

Don't ask me who I am but who I was
I'm not the man I used to be

The greed we share has brought me here

Tell me more, say your name. Is it...?

I have been your friend for all your time
I beg of you, speak comfort to me
I see your chain and realized that I
May not await a kinder fate

Your future's a horror story written by your crime
That you will have to pay for the rest of your time

Leave me alone, this cannot happen now

You will be haunted by 3 spirits
Expect the 1st to arrive at Midnight
The 2nd on the night after that
And the last spirit will arrive
On the 3rd night

Tell me why you doubt your senses

My mind can play me tricks, so could anyone

Now tonight you have three chances

Why can't all the spirits come at once?

Your chain is forged in life by your
Act of greed, can't you see, yours will come

Rainbow - Stargazer



High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?

Oh, I see his face

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
You might also like
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky

Oh, I see his face

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand

Oh, I see his face

Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

In heat and rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave me back my will
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Going home
I'm going home

Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear!

Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

Majestica - Above the Sky


Standing alone in darkness away from light you cannot see
No good times remembered, no eagles flying free
Then your hear a voice in the distant light
A light of gold and green
A song of hope and melody that makes you so serene
You count the rocks in your prison cell
You see them in your dreams
But hope of your return increases like a growing stream

We have to fly together beyond the sky forever
We have a short way to go when we fly away

Where the light is shining bright
Where it's never cold or night
Above the sky to a land far away
Where you're strong and never die
Where the maidens never cry
We have the key to paradise

Start with a D, then go to an F
The C will lead to G three more times
Then the verse is built before the chorus comes
This time the bridge is different from before
Like something flying free

With beats from the drum

So that we can rise again

Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

And I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free

Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes, I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see

When all my sins are washed away

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart

Never the heroes, we were sacrificed at war

Judas Priest - Children of the  Sun


Sun sets on the nations
World's in her disguise
Pray for all that matters
Saviour in my eyes

Children of the sun
Dying one by one

Eden has been wasted
Deadly poison fills the air
Kneel down in forgiveness
While there's still time, if you care

Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one

I couldn't dream
To be without her kind
They wouldn't let her be
Or heal what she defiled
You are the hate that beats mankind
Torturous lies that lead the blind
Squandered the truth from all we said
You are the reason I feel dead
You might also like

Mountains start to crumble
Tumble in the sea

Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one

Judas Priest - Night Crawler


Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers, a last resort
Homing in, its cry distorts
Terror struck, they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Beware the beast in black

You know he's coming back

He's gonna get you
Beware the beast

Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast

Judas Priest - Diamonds and Rust


I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Now I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there
You might also like
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust

Cain’s Offering - A Night to Forget


When lights go down lets have another round
Come here my love help me to search for my crown
A king of fools, I'm breaking all the rules
A drunken parody, I can't see the irony
This is my dynasty of pride and vanity
My broken self-esteem just can't face reality
Always the silent one, I was born to be undone
So I'll stay here in the darkness and I will

Leave everything, leave everything behind me
My every sigh and every little lie
All that I have are memories so frozen
No one is flawless but baby I'm the worst

Pour me another one, tell me I'll meet someone
A spoonful of sugar makes the poison go down
Feed my insanity, write me a tragedy
Let's make a memory a night to forget
Rain keeps pouring
I'll keep crawling

At 3 A.M I can't remember who I am
A sad and epic fail, I'm 3 on the Glasgow scale
Once again I vow "I'll make this right somehow"
It's just another lie, you'd cry If you could see me now
I'm such a travesty living out my fallacy
Leave it to me to be the killer and the casualty
Late nights and neon lights, a thousand wrongs and zero rights
These are the steps that I must follow and I will

A spoonful of sugar makes the poison go down
Feed my insanity, write me a tragedy
Let's make a memory a night to forget
Rain keeps pouring
I'll keep crawling

A shot of whiskey and some wine
A life in beautiful decline
I try to run, I try to hide
Intoxicated all the time
I'll build a bridge to watch it burn
Pour the ashes in the urn
And turn away just to start again

Pour me another one, tell me I'll meet someone
A spoonful of sugar makes the poison go down
Feed my insanity, write me a tragedy
Let's make a memory a night to forget
Pour me another one, tell me I'll meet someone

Cain’s Offering - Elegantly Broken

Silence is broken
Empty words arc licking the layers of sin from our skin
We realize happy endings are not for everyone, they're not for us
Break of dawn let us lay down our arms
In the end of the day we can savour our loss
But I never stopped trying and I never said I wasn't up for
A little bit of pain
A little bit of longing
Little bit of love to come our way
A little bit of fear
A little bit of hate
Little hope for the hopeless
A little bit of rain
A little bit of thunder
Little broken smile at the end of our day
A little stormy cloud
A little bit of wind
To breathe life into lifeless
You were always so much stronger than me
And now your pain has made you beautiful
But inside your armour is your heart still open, for here I stand
Still trapped in my solitary shell
Reaching out to you with my aching thoughts
Hear me now, please don't tell me that you are too proud for

Together we will be
So elegantly broken

Cain’s Offering - Antemortem


There's beauty in pain that paints every day
With colors that stay and won't fade away
In wounds that won't heal, in nightmares too real
They tell us that we can still feel

In fire we're forged and given a form
The harder the hammer, the stronger the soul
For all of our tears and all of our scars
They remind us of who we are

One is for the heart we left behind
One is for a friend who said goodbye
One is for the love we swore would never die
(But that was in another lifetime)
One is for the times we were denied
One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
(But that was in another lifetime)

We might've been kings, we might have been pawns
We might've been ducklings, we might have been swans
There's no grand design, there's only desire
You're either the pearl or the swine
For all that we've lost and our every tear
The choices we've made have brought us here
Everything we are, everything we have
We have built from fragments

One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
(But that was in another lifetime)
(That was in another lifetime)

Please believe in me because the man you see
Is not the man I used to be
We may always be alone and broken
But we have survived, we are alive
Please believe in me because the man you see
Is not the man I used to be
We may always be alone and broken

One is for the feelings locked inside
One is for the secrets that we've had to hide
(But that was in another lifetime)
Time after time, people try just to
Feel once more the fire that burns
Every time we fall to the ground
And everything we leave behind
(Oh, that was in another lifetime)
Time after time, people try just to
Feel once more the fire that burns
Every time we fall to the ground

Turned into bitter cheaters
In fever
We are the stars of the masquerade
Between the good and evil
Between the day and night
We are caught in between what's wrong and right
We're blinded by the power
Blinded by the light
It's a long winding road out of the night
Once like thunder in the distance
The world is soon on fire
The beast inside is ready for another lie
So
Believers, deceivers

Now the thunder is upon us
The world is set on fire
The beast is getting ready for the final fight
So
Believers, deceivers
Turned into bitter cheaters

We are the stars of the masquerade

Ember Falls - We Are Become Fire

Is there anyone out there for us?
With the city lain fallen to dust
Is there anything left to say
Our prayers now lie buried 'neath this rust
Is there any salvation for us?
In whatever is left of this crust
Maybe the devil is the only one to love
These souls in wanderlust
There's a reason why
It's the way we die
Undressing the sky
Twilight in our eyes
We are disposable
We are collateral
We are the fuel to the fires in terminal rise

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell
Your eyes scream, "The end is creeping in
I'll need 37 stitches, 37 stitches," yeah
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun
I know, I know
On the darkest side of the sun
You are the one on the darkest side of the sun

Jonathan Young - Children of Night


Let them hear us sing
Lost and broken souls
Trusted priest and king
All of the lies they told
They can hear our cries
Leave us in the cold
While the children die
Watch them count their gold

So if Heaven is filled with the likes of them
We dine in Hell instead

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread
We have alrеady died
For we are thе children of night

We are the children of night

Poison in the air
Can't afford the cure
Children unprepared
To die in father's war
Destruction and despair
What are you crying for?
We have their thoughts and prayers
And who could ask for more?
You might also like
So if Heaven is filled with the likes of them
We dine in Hell instead

We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread
We have already died
For we are the children of night
Hahahaha!


We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind
Breathe, fill your lungs with dread
We have already died
For we are the children of night
We are the young undead
Born in the grave of humankind

The Raven Age - Fleur de Lis


Can’t you see
A sign from god it came to me
Maybe something to believe
Is all our people really need
Have you lost your love
Look in their eyes they’ve given up
Watch as all our homes are burned
Salvation a far cry which I will return

Take a look around
How we’ve fallen from grace
I am the hand to liberate them

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king
A saviour peasant girl holds high the fleur de lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory

Follow me
On to reclaim the rightful king
We rise again and fight for him
For god has spoken to me
You must keep hope
This land we walk upon is our home
This kingdom is now a shadow of its past
And I condemn this game for thrones
You might also like
Take a look around all they needed was faith
And now our souls have all awakened

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king
A saviour peasant girl holds high the fleur de lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory

Fight with me
Hold up high the fleur de lis
Our future has us on our knees
So bury all these memories
Fight with me
Die for what is yours
To be free again
One last time
(Fight with me)

Heresy defeats the uncrowned king
A saviour peasant girl holds high the fleur de lis
In the fire she burns with spirit high
For all eternity lives on her memory

Sonic Syndicate - Turn It Up!


Turning up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
(Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do...)

Your body's swaying from side to side
I want to catch you when you fall
But then you'll have learnt nothing at all
Still, I'm ready to run
But you're so damn drunk
An atomic bomb couldn't wake you up
What's that you hear?
Bass and lights from the club?
I don't think so; I'm by your side
And all I hear is ambulance siren cries
Screaming, "Help me
Help me, help me, help me"

But the way that you looked

Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Sooner or later, you're gonna come loose
What the fuck you gonna do?
Turn it up like you always do
Head to toe, covered in tattoos
Broken nails and a bleeding soul
Suck it up, you fuckin' ho!

The way she walks, the way she talks

You're selling your soul for whiskey and Coke
And you're a suicide for tequila and lime
And I got to admit
When I first saw you hit the dance floor
With your grind
You sent me out of my mind
But after watching you crawl
In the door at 5:00 AM
It's getting old
Out of soul, out of dough, out of all
But you're screaming, "I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care! I don't care!"

But the way that she looked

Prędzej z nieba spadnie Ziemia, niż to się zacznie zmieniać
Nadstaw twarz!
Otępiałe stada tych, co wolą w niemocy żyć
Iluzją karmieni, by za rękę złapać i
Zrobić chcą wciąż lejąc krew przeludniony chlew

Myślą, że czary to droga do spełnienia snów
Prędzej z nieba spadnie Ziemia, niż to się zacznie zmieniać
Nadstaw twarz!
Chcesz widzieć, chcesz myśleć
W tym toksycznym zestawieniu dziwnych cnot
Zanim wciągnie cię
Każdy ruch przybliża tego bagna dno
Chcesz ustać, chcesz krzyczeć
Lecz stłumione usta grzęzną gubiąc ton
Rozbij zgniłą toń

But you are in control

Am I the son of evil
In this mad masquerade
I know what's waiting for me
I will be the one to blame

And every day
You're lying to me
Step by step

Adapt one more time
I'm leaving bad memories behind me
You are a big pretender
The one that knows it all
An egocentric figure
Stabbing backs
To reach your goals
I scream to make you hear me
I lie to underline
What you are doing to me
You have crossed the borderline

We all see in black and white
When it comes to someone else's fight
No one ever gets involved
Apathy can never solve

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation

Respect is something that you earn
Our Indian brothers' getting burned
Original American
Turned into a second class citizen

Yes, no, yes, no
Not another word
You'll know what to do

In their face you take it
Make up their minds
Aggression turns the screws
Fight, take your piece and hold it
Make your peace and stand up

Wake up, time to live your dreams

Down by
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideals
Down by
Law and no-one owns you
And all the shit they've thrown you

Avenged Sevenfold - Afterlife


Like walkin' into a dream
So unlike what you've seen
So unsure, but it seems
'Cause we've been waitin' for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light
But girl, this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life, and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
You might also like
Place of hope and no pain
Perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place, but refrain
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
Of your afterlife here, so stay
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right
(Up with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place, don't wanna stay
I feel wrong, and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Gave me your hand, but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand, I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I've gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right
Loved ones back home all cryin' 'cause they're already missin' me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken, I'm chokin' on this ecstasy)
Oh, Lord, I'll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live! Ah!)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time, I'm right
To move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you, and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside

Counterfeit - Enough

Hello, is this thing on?
Excuse us for our absence
We were out in the cold
We're sick to death of hearing shots in the night
And the hate that you keep preaching
And your words full of spite
It's time 'cos we've had enough
You bring your guns, we bring our hearts
And our weapons of love
I hope you watch as we take to the streets
Because together we are stronger
And as one we bring peace
I'll label myself as a voice of a people who feels
Disenfranchised and fucked off again
'Cos every time that we think we make progress you come and
Destroy what we fought to rebuild
And nothing was born out of nothing
It's time to unite
And just show them our strenghth
The enemy can be defeated
As long as we stand up together and sing
Let us live
Let us love
Let us show you
That enough is enough

Keep pounding your feet
I know there's anger in your blood
But you remember to keep the love that
Those cunts tried to put out
Because their violence and murder is not

Disenfranchised and fucked off again
'Cos every time that we think we make progress you come and
Destroy what we fought to rebuild
And nothing was born out of nothing
It's time to unite
And just show them our strength
The enemy can be defeated
As long as we stand up together and sing
Let us live
Let us love
Let us show you

Danger is around us but can't be seen
There is nothing left but your fear
Total confusion, we've lived in lies
Time is no longer running out

Let the thunder strike the sky
Here I'm standing between lightning, still alive
In the triangle, where's no life
I am drowning in the rain but still alive
I won't die

Its secret powers lie in wait for me
Being here means I'll disappear
No laws of physics, no nature's rules
Who enter this place is a fool

Let the thunder strike the sky
Here I'm standing between lightning, still alive
In the triangle, where's no life
I am drowning in the rain but still alive
I won't die

You call on me as bells begin to chime

Are you ready to swear right here, right now before the devil?
That you're on the square? That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now? Right here, right now

Hiding from the light, sacrificing nothing
Still, you call on me for entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails into a sacred coffin
You call on me for powers clandestine

Are you on the square? Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now before the devil?
That you're on the square? That you're on the level?

CyHra - Heartrage


They told me to be strong
Prolong
Ambivalent
The future was my past
I was decadent
I felt my heart beat like
A beating drum
I know that I was blind, alone
Uncertainly, I left without a sound
Afraid my enemy
A constant battle that keeps going on

Headstrong I fell into oblivion
Revenge is burning in my mind

So this is how you're killing me
Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise
You might also like
Was I the one that sold a false conspiracy
Hold on tight, it empowers me
To take this final battle for another spin

I know that I am my own worst enemy

Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise

I see my pain reflecting in the hundred thousand pieces
Scattered all around me from the mirror
Now we're even
After all these years
Feel my blood and tears
Ain't saying I am a saint you say I hurted you
I am picking up the pieces
I am leaving you
Time to say farewell
We will never meet again
So this is how you're killing me
Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise

Arion - At The Break Of Dawn

And I know
We have to run before we're at the break of dawn
No one can win this war
Wisest to close that door
To erase what we've adored
The memories and the dreams we have lived for
It's the time to kill this fear
We're both degenerating year by year
I thought it would be always clear
'til the end we both had sworn to be sincere
Crossed the line too many times, our world is upside down
Can't go on, it's the time to turn around
And I know
We have to let it go
Escape before we lie on ocean floor
I know
When all the hope is gone
We have to run before we're at the break of dawn
No one turned the hourglass
Forget and leave the past behind
And I will always ask
Why anything that's beautiful can't last
You might also likeIt's the time to make it right
Turn back and walk towards the light
The dark can be turned bright
We'll end this twisted fairytale tonight
Close your eyes for just one time and lose your paradise
All we had is gone, it must be sacrificed
And I know
We have to let it go
Escape before we lie on ocean floor
And I know
When all the hope is gone
We have to run before we're at the break of dawn
And I know
We have to let it go
Escape before we lie on ocean floor
And I know
When all the hope is gone
We have to run before we're at the break of dawn

Megadeth - À Tout le Monde


Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans, denied

So, as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all

À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred

Barking
Here north and nether he's bound
And here he dwell
Snarling
At passing ghosts though he guard
The gates of Hel
They're leaving like a funeral procession on the prowl
Behind the hearse of all our hope
Their coming may forebode the end of all wee once held high
Before us darkness gathers
You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Neither sand stays their striding
Nor does the dark and deep blue sea
Frontlines fell
You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Turned to stone by the sunrise
Hordes in the distance marching out
The gates of Hel
Graven
Under the gathering grime
Statues forgrow
Fieldstones

Wayfarers flow

Welcome to a state of dreams
Where everything's as real as you let it be
I will be your host this eve
So sit back, relax and I guarantee

You crave it, awake it, the coeur bizarre
Lose yourself to the twisted art

Hey, you'll be amazed
Let your demons out

Inspiration lunaire
Descendant d'Kaguya
Quand j'parle à mes démons j'me sens fort comme le Rikudo
Attiré par la mort, comme si j'lui devais ma vie
Jamais abandonner : c'est mon nindo, c'est ma devise
Enfant d'Saiyajin vas-y, devine c'est qui mon père mais
Gon et Killua ce sera le prénom d'mes deux fils ouais, ouais
L'impression qu'le monde est à moi pourtant
J'reste devant mon écran à rêver d'aventure comme si
J'attendais qu'Ryûk vienne me voir
J'ai plus d'espoir et l'côté sombre en moi rêve de tuer des gens
Et j'ai peur de céder sous l'coup d'la folie
Oh mon Dieu, protège-moi
Nan, j'veux pas faire partie des vilains, nan-nan-nan
J'veux pas faire partie des vilains (yeah, yeah)
On les évite, on les envie
Enfermés dans leur villa
T'es costumé pendant qu'moi j'suis toujours en Fila, jure (hein)
J'surveille ce monde en filature
Ce monde passe tellement vite, le temps défile
J'suis Kagami, les portes de  vont s'ouvrir  vont m'faire mourir
Chapeau de paille sur la tête quand j'navigue sur Grandline
Tout est noir, j'arrête, pour mes problèmes j'ai une hotline (allô)
J'suis pas connu et j'veux pas l'être, j'espère qu't'as compris (ouais, ouais)
J'rentre en force dans l'game comme Luffy dans la son-pri (ouais, ouais)
Grâce à Alphonse maintenant j'sais qu'la vie a un prix
Si j'parle du mal c'est parce que la vie m'l'a appris
J'compte chaque seconde de ma vie comme Senku
J'me relèverai, poto, même après 100 coups

Oh how ingenious, the centuries of lies
Ezekiel's chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts
Forget because we know
Souls are recycled in
The death and resurrection show
O beloved woman of liberty
Hold me in your arms

Rise Against - Give It All


Break through the undertow
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Cough words I can't speak, so I
Stop my struggling
Then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

I give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottom's where we live
And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking under tension
Before far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses
Up from the dirt

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me
You might also like
Breathe (breathe)
The air we give (give)
The life we live (live)
Our pulses racing distances
(Breathe) so wet my tongue
(Give) break into song
(Live) through seas of competition

So please believe your eyes
A sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight
Home tonight

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Today I offer all myself to this
I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all
Now there's a reason
There's a reason
To give it all

Snapcase - Skeptic

Fall back in into the line and realize a time of no return
Don't look back!
Fear evokes anxiety and overwhelms the emotions that we bleed
Embrace your freedom!
Something that you need to know
Of what it is we'll face;
An emotion that you cannot show
But it has to be this way
We lost ourselves deliberately to find ourselves a life of lesser pain
Find a new Rhythm!
So we stand to look ahead and face ourselves to what we fear the most
A life that's uncertain!
Something that you need to know
Of what it is we'll face;
An emotion that you cannot show
But it has to be this way
And it only seems so strange right now
And it only feels to be different now

And we're at it again
I turn around, another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin
But I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're following

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit
Behind the blood between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see and everyone eventually will take the step
'Cause it's in sight you take the left, I'll take the right
I feel the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah

But it wasn't a sin
A sorry life judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit
You forget how to speak
How to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do
From on the outside looking in your government is listening
To push you on the story of immortal father mortal son
Give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)

If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell
And your future's a fucking disaster, can't you see?
Don't give them all the power
When your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to

Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system
Most would claim I live a lie (I live a lie)
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things (Predict these things)
Every color has its side (I have a side)
They live together, vote and most embrace the same dark times
Please help us, please save us
Of course they have control, we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem
Drove the nail and let him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end
I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see
How the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder about
How you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow
But decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to (Run)

You have fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dying one by one
How it ends I'll never know

Only you (Only you) are the life (Life) among the dead
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie (Bring me to life)
There's nothing inside (There's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Evanescence - My Immortal


I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

And these wounds won't seem to heal
And this pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me, ah

Me, ah
Me, ah

Fall Out Boy - Centuries


Du du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries

We are the poisoned youth

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up

Burn everything you love then burn the ashes

Spat back out the monster that you see

Fall Out Boy - The Phoenix


Put on your war paint

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me

But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still, your secrets I will keep

You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be dead

Ashes Remain - On My Own


There's gotta be another way out
I've been stuck in a cage with my doubt
I've tried forever getting out on my own
But every time I do this my way
I get caught in the lies of the enemy
I lay my troubles down
I'm ready for you now

Bring me out
Come and find me in the dark now
Everyday by myself I'm breaking down
I don't wanna fight alone anymore
Bring me out
From the prison of my own pride
My God
I need a hope I can't deny
In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own

Every little thing that I've known is every thing I need to let go
You're so much bigger than the world I have made
So I surrender my soul
I'm reaching out for your hope
I lay my weapons down
I'm ready for you now

Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams


I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a—

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

Sum 41 - Still Waiting


So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say

Sunrise Avenue - Fairytale Gone Bad


This is the end, you know
Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears
We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realize there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind
Get out of my head, out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad

Another night and I bleed
They all make mistakes and so did we
But we did something we can never turn back right
Find a new one to fool
Leave and don't look back, I won't follow
We have nothing left, it's the end of our time

Paranoia is in bloom, the PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around

Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious

Come let the revolution take its toll

You'd see that we should never be afraid to die

Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

I've been looking for a way to bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me
"If you love me
Let it die"

Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating

This ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching
I can feel you out there

Save me if I become
My demons

Take me over the walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy
The enemy

Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one and the same
You take all of the pain away

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay

Styx - Boat on the River


Take me back to my boat on the river
I need to go down, I need to come down
Take me back to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out any more

Time stands still as I gaze in her waters
She eases me down, touching me gently
With the waters that flow past my boat on the river
So I don't cry out anymore

Oh, the river is wise
The river, it touches my life like the waves on the sand
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base
Where the frown on my face disappears

Take me down to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out anymore

The river, it touches my life like the waves on the sand
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base
Where the frown on my face disappears, whoa

Mike Oldfield - Nuclear


Standing on the edge of the crater
Like the prophets once said
And the ashes are all cold now
No more bullets and the embers are dead
Whispers in the air tell the tales
Of the brothers gone
Desolation, devastation
What a mess we made, when it all went wrong

Watching from the edge of the circus
For the games to begin
Gladiators draw their swords
Form their ranks for armageddon

I'm nuclear
I'm wild
I'm breaking up inside
A heart of broken glass
Defiled
Deep inside
The abandoned child

Standing on the edge of the underworld
Looking at the abyss
And I'm hoping for some miracle
To breakout, to escape from all this
Whispers in the air tell the tales
Of a life that's gone
Desolation, devastation
What a mess we made, when it all went wrong

I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge
It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge

No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

(Can you, can you, can you, can you)
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge
This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate

Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know?


Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?

Florence + the Machine - No Light, No Light


You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said
You are the nighttime fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over, you're the start
You're my head and you're my heart

No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light (No light)
Tell me what you want me to say

Through the crowd I was crying out and
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right

Tell me what you want me to say

Would you leave me
If I told you what I've done?
And would you leave me
If I told you what I've become?
'Cause it's so easy
To say it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love
To say it to you out loud
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay (Oh-oh)

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder

Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

Bon Jovi - Livin' On A Prayer


Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

Bon Jovi - You Give Love a Bad Name


Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Apocalyptica - Not Strong Enough


I'm not strong enough to stay away
Can't run from you, I just run back to you
Like a moth, I'm drawn in to your flame
Say my name, but it's not the same
You look in my eyes
I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders
And you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away

In your presence, my heart knows no shame

Bishop Lamont - Team America: Fuck Yeah Anthem

{Samples taken from the film Team America}
America. America
America, FUCK YEAH!
 
America
America, FUCK YEAH!
 
I love the smell of napalm in the mornin'
Drink my hot cocoa to fuckin' get to waring
Kiss my wife goodbye, sniff a couple grams of coke
Can't wait to get in the tank and blow me up a bunch of folks (I'LL FUCK YOU UP!)
Drive through the streets sittin' on top of the Jeeps
Anybody diss America, we got beef (FUCK YOU AND YOUR
Hear Obama pop a lot of pills with Biden
Kumbaya, motherfuckers we ridin'
What's wrong with the world?
What's wrong with the world?
When you can't marry your cousin?
Uncle, I love that little girl (I LOVE HER!)
Rappers lovin' auto-tune, gay parade beats
I will destroy you, no surrender, no retreat
Hop on a plane, take a trip with Bill Clinton
Savin' poor bitches from Korea, got 'em strippin'
Straight dick lickin'
Girls goin' wild
It's Team America, we do it doggy style!
There was a time when America would've dropped a nuclear bomb on Iraq
And we would have had a big fancy party down in Time Square. (Fuck yeah!)
You see, America is getting soft on me
Right now as we speak there's little nappy niggers pubes on the presidential pillow cases
And God forbid the Oval Office start to smell like cocoa butter. (America, Fuck yeah!)
Fuck that shit
 
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, yeah
WHOOOOO!
Ignorance is bliss
You only take baths and always smell like cumbermint (you smell like a bitch)
I heard you tried to grow nuts and try to assassinate
I don't know, but those shots a bit belligerent
I get loaded and blow away an innocent (sorry)
But Dick Chaney aim, and call the death an accident
Vanessa Hudgens and a bag of sand matchstick (I like 'em young!)
Her 18th birthday and a box of Cealisis
American as apple pie
Cross my heart twice and hope you fuckin' die
We gunnin' through the jungle, like FarCry
Bulletproof doors, stampedes and evil eyes
Keep it pushin' like drive-bys
Hit the blunt and blow the rest of the smoke to the sky
I got grenades and they're all live
And you about to blow, so have a good fuckin' time buddy
You see, my daddy used to always say, "Never do business with a jigaboo."
And that's exactly why I'm breakin' apart from President Obama and putting together an elite team of spys
These spys will be called Team America: Special Forces
This team will be the last branch of government that is truly American
 
I live Michael Jackson even though he was a nigger
America's the best that's why he made Thriller
Fuck Deb Berrow, I'll kill that ho
Granny go the kids you ain't gettin' no doe
Got to kill with these terrorists right now but I'll be back
To kill you, John & Kate and all them rugrats
That ain't a show
That shit's fuckin' square
A real American show is Golden Girls, hell yeah!

Eat McDonalds till my heart clogs
Crush Vicodin and sniff it through a drink straw
Let it sink till my sanity stops
Then order a hundred candy bars and chips through pink dot
And cruise the Gaza Strip in a T-top
And let 'em all have it, man we won't stop
I'mma shoot you in the stomach till your shit drops
John Ritter syndrome, make your heart stop
Okay fellas, what I'm about to tell you is top secret
For years Adam Sandler has been foolin' America into believing all Jews are friendly
If Adam Sandler makes one more movie, everyone will become Jewish
Your first mission is to find Adam Sandler and destroy him. Good luck
(America, FUCK YEAH!) (Bitch)

This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no

Well, I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come

With what we throw away

Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman?
Thought you was Batman (Na-na)
And hit the party with a gas can?
Kiss me, you animal!

(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) You run the company
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Fuck like a Kennedy
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Let's blow an artery
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Eat plastic surgery
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here, right now, all the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open, filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to Heaven
And all the juvie halls, and the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now
I'll be your detonator


(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Make no apology
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) It's death or victory
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) On my authority
Crash and burning, young and loaded
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Drop like a bullet shell
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) Dress like a sleeper cell
(Na, na-na-na, na-na-na) I'd rather go to Hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode

The Nearly Deads - My Evil Ways

I never thought there were people like me
Just a little bit dark, we like it harder
No matter if the sky is grey
You know, we even kind of like it that way
I never knew I could feel like this
My thoughts are twisted, wrong and wicked
Always knew that I wasn't the only one
I found you, let's have some fun
Calling me strange gives me confidence
Cause I take it as a complement
Maybe I'll change my evil ways
Stop taking shots one of this days
I'll settle down, I'll rearrange
Maybe I'll learn from my mistakes
Stop breaking hearts, forgetting names
I'll settle down and act my age
One of these days
But not today
There came a point where everything clipped
And something snapped and that was that, yeah
My life was just beginning
Don't have to go on pretending
I always knew that I wasn't alone
I feel like I'm finally home

Take me, I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind

I can see in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
And every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die

Show me all the things that I shouldn't know

Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
After all, there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself time after time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us, this time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift...nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia

With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another, but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land
In the temple of love, you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on
Walls as wide as lovers' eyes
In the temple of love
Shine like thunder
In the temple of love
Cry like rain
In the temple of love
Hear my calling
In the temple of love
Hear my name
And the devil in a black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away

On trembling legs, you open the door
And you scream... on Halloween

Where am I now?
Is there anybody out there?
What has happened?
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell?
I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining

It's shining on me, yeah


I am the one, doom's in my hands
Now make your choice:
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory

DragonForce - Through the Fire and Flames



On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know

So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!

As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day, this misery must go on

So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh


Now, here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now, can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!

Helloween - I Want Out


From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school, they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So, they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point, you give it up
So, the only thing that's left to think is this:

I want out—to live my life alone
I want out—leave me be
I want out—to do things on my own
I want out—to live my life and to be free

People tell me "A" and "B"
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So, they push me, then, from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear
You might also like
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out—to live my life alone
I want out—leave me be
I want out—to do things on my own
I want out—to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways (Million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (Million ways)
In the end of it (In the end), none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (Alone, alone, alone)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone
To live my life alone
I want out—leave me be
I want out—to do things on my own
I want out—to live my life and to be free
I want out

But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing, Amen, I

Singing Amen, I

If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride

If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

Limp Bizkit - Behind Blue Eyes


No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

To be mistreated
To be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows how to say
That they're sorry
And don't worry
I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
No one knows what it's like

To be the sad man

A sound of rustling
Is it the wind or is it you
I'm hiding in a cornfield
Afraid of what you might do
It's turning into a maze
Feels like I'm running for days

He's on a hunt and ready to kill
He thinks it's fun it is his thrill
I'm chased by a murderer

It is his choice to let me run
With an evil laugh on his face
You can see he's having fun
It's just a matter of time
For this place to become a scene of a crime

Amberian Dawn - Magic Forest

Just moments before the dawn
It's their time to go
One look and they entered the magic forest
They're left alone
A strange weight surrounded them
It felt like burned ice
All branches like fingers they reach to catch them
Leaving their marks

Amberian Dawn - Valkyries

Ravens over battlefield are marking the chosen
Brave northern warriors to their last fight
Shieldmaidens ride the wolves in the sky with ravens
Scouting the battleground for souls of slain heroes
Choosers of slain
Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves!
Howling wolves in the night carrying female deities
Escort the dead warriors to Odin's hall
Armour of Valkyries flashes up over the skies
Shading a strange light - the northern lights!
Choosers of slain
Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries

The song that angels sing
The spell that calls the Gathering
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering
I see a world in anger
I see a world in pain
Each day a different story
But still the message is the same
Hard news I set beside me
Sweet dreams is what I need
What daylight wants to show me
At night, appears to be insane
May I ask you in?
Shall I...
Shall I persuade you?
The song that angels sing

Visions of Atlantis - The Deep & the Dark


Shut the light, call the night, bring my safety back
Are they gone, I hear none, as all fades to black
But your hands on my shoulder's calming me down
Build a wall, start a war, here they come for me
Grab the sword, come on board, face my enemy
But you silence all their cries when you speak your loving words
Be my sunrise
Redemption lies in your eyes

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in
Losing faith on my battleground
The shadows leave their mark
Your light brings me back from
The deep and the dark

Take my hand, make a stand, and then hold your breath
See what comes, see what runs, in the face of death
How is it that you never seem to worry?
You might also likeIn the end, I must bend, and then hold or break
Kneel to pray, come what may, when my soul's at stake
And you loosen all the knots with a smile on your face
In this rat race
The enemy wears my face

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in
Losing faith on my battleground
The shadows leave their mark
Your light brings me back from
The deep and the dark

Come take my hand, take my heart
Keep me safe, keep me warm
They take my pride, take this life
But they won't take my soul

You are my antidote
When the waves of doubts rush in
As I drown in my memories
The darkness creeps in
Losing faith when I look around
Madness leaves a mark
Brings death to your doorway
The deep and the dark

Visions of Atlantis - Heroes of the Dawn


As the tide whispers of unspoken stories
Of two lovers from an ancient realm
Who have bent the rules and broken spells
And changed the world of men

Two free souls who dreamt they could escape
All norms and codes that they could not obey
Other folks would mock their different heart
And let them go astray

Green were the meadows, the forests
But the oceans carried a greater promise

Without highs, without lows
Without dreams left to sow
Till they came here
Heroes of the dawn
As they showed that all love
Doesn't fall from above
But is found
Like comfort in a storm
You might also like
But their magic wasn't meant to last
Vile envy lurking every now and then
As they burnt too bright and burnt too fast
In the eyes of other men

And the waves crowned with the whitest laces
Soon the grave for these beautiful minds
All the folks would talk as now are gone
The last ones of their kind

Green were the meadows, the forests
But the oceans carried a greater promise

Without highs, without lows
Without dreams left to sow
Till they came here
Heroes of the dawn
As they showed that all love
Doesn't fall from above
But is found
Like comfort in a storm
Because the crown they defied
Sentenced without a trial


If you listen at dawn
They still sing with the sun
Their legend belongs to the light
As they showed that all love
Doesn't fall from above
But remains
In corners of the heart

Without highs, without lows
Without dreams left to sow
Till they came here
Heroes of the dawn
But the folks of today
So frightened to love again
Have buried their name long ago

Sirenia - Dim Days Of Dolor

Frozen in the moment
Seems like time is standing still
This life feels like a cyanide pill
The sun rise, a new morning
It's the same strife, different day
The grim reaper meets me in the doorway
I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way
To fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away
Broken by this moment
Seems like I have lost the will
The will to carry on further still
The sundown, darkness falling
It all ends right where it begins
I pray for forgiveness for my sins
I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way
To fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away
You might also likeCan you see through the fire
Can you see through the rain
And you walk through flames
Have we all become insane
Is this my funeral pyre
Burning brightly and in vain
Faceless strangers without names
Haunts you over and over again
I'm just barely alive
I don't know if I will survive
Yet another day, another way
To fade and deteriorate
I've been losing my mind
I've been falling way behind
I'm a lost survivor, walking through fire
But strength is giving away

Sirenia - Into the Night

1 ContributorInto the Night LyricsInto the eye of the storm
Deception and scorn
Dark clouds taking form
Into the depths of the sea
I can not breathe
I'm lulled into sleep
I'm sinking deeper in a bottomless sea
(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things
Into the lingering dark
No light in my heart
No gleam, nor a spark
Into the realms of the moon
A bright silver spoon
A dying maroon
The undertaker emerged way too soon
(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things

Sirenia - Lost in Life

1 ContributorLost in Life LyricsA fading hope and a broken dream
Is all there is for me
It's all there was and will ever be
And I keep falling further down
We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can’t deny
We've been lost all the time
There's no way to cope for these wasted years
Nor for these long lost tears
I'm giving in to all my fears
As I keep falling further down
We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can’t deny
We've been lost all the time
We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
Time keeps passing us by, but we can’t deny
We've been lost all the time
We are lost in this life, you and I
We've been living a lie
(We've been living a lie)
Time keeps passing us by, but we can’t deny
We've been lost all the time

If you were here
I'd whisper sweet nothings in your ear
And appeal to all your fears
If you were mine (if you were only mine)
I'd bring you so much further down
And twist your mind until the end of time

You will never realize
What darkness lies inside, inside my mind

If you are down
I will come to chain you to the ground
And penetrate your mind
If you are lost (even if you are lost)
I'll be there to break your trust
And ravage all your lust for life, my love

You will never realize

Sail away my little sister
Sail away to the other side
There's a light and a darkened road
There's a night and a fading hope
There was a dream that once was mine
But now it seems it has passed with time
Sail away my little sister
Sail away to the other side (to the other side)
Sail away my little sister
Sail away far into the night
Where times seems much better
Than this void called life
There's a voice inside my head
There's a hope, now long since dead
It's all a wonder, will I abide
I hear you calling from the other side
I hear you calling from the other side
Sail away my little sister
Sail away to the other side (to the other side)

Vandroya - Why Should We Say Goodbye?

Now it's time
I feel that it can't be the end
How could we just live without our love?
Saying goodbye
It's not the thing I want yet
And don't have those moments anymore
Remember All the words you said to me
That couldn't be a lie
When you try to say the truth
I am standing here for you
Dreaming of a nearly past
Trying to be and do the best
While you're breaking up my heart
I'm counting the stars
Tell me why
Why should we say goodbye?
Tell me now
How can I just live without
The life that we had dreamed once before
Save me now
My heart is tired of fight it out
Stop this pain and close this dammed hole
Remember All the words you'd heard from me
Coz' it you can't deny
When you try to say the truth
I am standing here for you
Dreaming of a nearly past
Trying to be and do the best
While you're breaking up my heart
I'm counting the stars
Tell me why
Why should we say goodbye?
I must be just dreaming
You said you loved me so believe me
There's a light that I've met in you and
It's the only way to save me
When you are so distant
I cannot stand my own existance
There's a flame that still burns here inside my heart
This nightmare won't free me
Oh baby, don't you dare to live me
Coz' you're inside my heart
When you try to say the truth
I am standing here for you
Dreaming of a nearly past
Trying to be and do the best
While you're breaking up my heart
I'm counting the stars
Tell me why
Why should we say goodbye?
While you're breaking up my heart
I'm counting the stars
Tell me why
Why should we say goodbye?

Somewhere deep into the memories of night
Secret signs are blazing a trail for
Somewhere far away in the cryptic mist -
Two eyes still waiting for the light

I see you far away
In the sorrow of the night
When the shadows fall and the darkness rise
You are shining still
I want to hear your scream of pain
Don’t stop to cry my sun
I feel your fly into a rage
Memory of night, day of thousands tears
The eyes are ocean of the pain
The Crying of the Sun

Scream for you to keep the memory in mind
Do you remember where is the way through the night?


Night of endless dreams light up the moment of forgiveness
In the silent moon I’m praying for your tears

There is always beauty when you feel someone’s heart
In the frozen steps of someone’s life
Break the surface of the mantle’s dark
Blind for your soul full of blood
There is always beauty when you leave someone’s heart
Burned eyes from the flash of ashes
Fatal clash without way out
Sad but beautiful
And  so much passion
Hopeless eyes and a broken arrow
In the heart of life where you burned my eyes
Undefended hearts and so much tears
We are runners over Blade of Love
Cover our hearts with the scars of pain
Loosing ourselves in the nameless shade
We are prisoners in the hands of Fate
You’re my Fallen Angel in the Hell
There is always passion when you lose someone’s love
You don’t have to say goodbye
We’ll pray for you
Sad but beautiful
The beauty of your escape
Your evil heart killed my sight for light
In the silence of unspoken tears
Wasted lifeblood in the name of nothing
Stealing our last breath

Lyriel - Leverage

I've carried a weight a very long time
Like a black stone, a hopeless crime
Past the fields, past the towns
I've measured hills and dales
Up and down
If I rest I am sure you are there waiting
For my mind to break down
And your soul to take control
I am here, I'm not going down
I will carry on to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your whispering lies
I am not yours to take down
I covered my face in the darkest night
Changed my name and foolish hopes
You are still lingering here in every thought
Still myself and still yours
If I rest I am sure you are there waiting
For my mind to break down
And your soul to take control
I am here, I'm not going down
I will carry on to do what I must do
To see the truth behind your whispering lies
I am not yours to take down

To see the truth behind your whispering lies

Moonlight Haze - It's Insane


It's been a couple of days now since it all has begun
Something has changed inside me and there is much going on
I Just cannot see the world the way that I did before
I'm sick and tired of distress, I always worry too much

I want to live my days like after one glass of good wine
When you're still sober but bad thoughts start to leave from your mind
I can perceive every atom of this body of mine
It might sound silly but hey, I know at least I should try

Flames and fire spitting sparks inside my soul
It all seems so right to me although I know...

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel thе flames, no more pain
Nevеr felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain
You might also like
It's like the first ray of sun after a week in the dark
My fears are melting away, I know they've left a deep mark
It all unravels so easily from this new perspective
Oh, Freedom is so addictive!

Flames and fire through my veins, sparks in my eyes
This is how I want to live even if I realize...

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain
Uh, it's insane!


It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
That's the way of the world
So I'm ready to glow
I will go with the flow from now on
I want to live my days like after one glass of good wine
I won't let the embers die
I won't give up my fire

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain

("IBIS REDIBIS NON MORIERIS IN BELLO")

Quasi l'abba ma pace non c'è
Troppi pensieri che girano in testa
Forse domani sapremo il perchè
Di questo tormento che resta
È' difficile scegliere sai
Quando l'insicurezza si desta
Tardi per tornare indietro oramai
Si scatenerà la tempesta

Segreti che ci legano

Un'enigma d'irrealtà
Di presunta sobrietà
Non è facile intuire dove stia la verità
Siam confusi sempre più
Poi ridotti in schiavitù
E' una strana sensazione di precipitarе giù

Il tuo sguardo mi osserva da un po’
Ogni mio movimento è silenzio
Tutti dеttagli che io ignorerò
S’insinuano nella memoria
Illusioni di ciò che accadrà
Indelebili sensi di colpa
Muri invisibili s'ergon tra noi
Ciò che è accaduto è ormai storia

E' una strana sensazione di precipitare giù

Un inferno di parole urlate, frasi a metà
Nessuno cederà
Chissà da qui fino a dove poi si arriverà

Alestorm - 1741 (The Battle of Cartagena)


Sailing the raging seas
To distant lands unknown
Portobelo fell in a day
Now Britannia rules the waves
Thirty thousand men at arms
Red Ensign in the sky
To Cartagena we set sail
With blood and plunder we'll prevail

Twice struck, and twice we've failed
But third time works a charm
The greatest fleet the world has seen
To fight the War of Jenkins' Ear
Waters lash across the bow
Through Carribean Seas
The year is 1741
The final battle has begun

The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena
The sands of time will remember our names
The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena
History is written today

Our captain gives a cry
Cartagena lies ahead
The Spanish foe will soon be dead!
Portents of coming doom
Engulf the battle line
High above, the heavens sigh
A red light burning in the sky

An omen of dread
Which no man can deny
The legends hold true
We must turn back or die
Superstitious fools
Be gone from my sight
Blast the trumpets of war
And prepare for the fight

The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena
The sands of time will remember our names
The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena
History is written today
Hard to starboard
Man the cannons
And on my command
Unleash hell!
FIRE! Show them your steel!
Bring them to death on the battlefield
Ride on the wind, and conquer the foe
The legends be damned, to our deaths we will go

The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena
The sands of time will remember our names
The skies are burning with thunder
The seas are ablaze with flame
Set the course to Cartagena

Alestorm - Captain Morgan's Revenge


Countless years ago, while lost in barren seas
There whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny
We took up arms and slayed the officers of rank
And with swords drawn, made the captain walk the plank

But as he fell down to the depths, he swore a deadly curse
"As sure as hell's my final fate, you'll all soon die or worse"
Now as we stand before the gallows waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we will dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has lead us to this fate
So have no fear and don't look back
The afterlife awaits

We returned to port with sorrow in our chests
An evil shadow followed us on every quest
Never to feel joy again was our fate
Only misery and death, fear and burning hate

We broke the law, betrayed the code, now time is running out
An unforgivable offence, oh, of that there is no doubt
Now as we stand before the gallows waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend
You might also like

So have no fear and don't look back

Many years have passed now
Yet, the curse still lives on
And now we rot in a black prison cell
Waiting for our true calling in hell

But for the lives we leave behind, don't shed a tear, don't cry
The only way to break this curse is for us all to die
Now as we stand before the gallows waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we will dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has lead us to this fate
So have no fear and don't look back
The afterlife awaits
At sunrise we will dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig

Oi you, gies a beer

Piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay
And we go home poor at the end of the day
But I'd rather live my life in rags
Than be chained to a desk with a wife that's a hag
We live each day like there's nothing to lose
But a man has needs and that need is booze
They say all the best things in life are free
So give all your beer and your rum to me

And steal your rum at the point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

Alestorm - Fucked with an Anchor


Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all
Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all
(Go!)

For thirty odd years, I have lived with this curse
My vocabulary was stunted at birth
By a witch doctor from over the seas
Casting a strange voodoo magic on me
Now when I speak, it's rather absurd
An endless tirade of four letter words
I lash out in anger at all in my way
Shocking unspeakable things that I say

Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all
Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all

Long I have waited to have my revenge
To bring that witch doctor to his bitter end
So I have gathered a ship and a crew
We're sailing to find him, we know what to do
On a dark moonless night, when he least suspects
We'll creep up behind him, so hard to detect
We'll bring out our anchor by the light of the stars
And shove it inside of his big fuckin' arse

Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all
Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all


Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all
Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker
We're gonna punch you right in the balls
Fuck you with a fucking anchor
You're all cunts so fuck you all

Alestorm - Keelhauled


My friends I stand before you
To tell a truth most dire
There lurks a traitor in our midst
Who hath invoked the captain's ire
He don't deserve no mercy
We ought to shoot him with a gun
But I am not an evil man
So first let's have a little fun

We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

Keelhaul that filthy landlubber
Send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank
With a bottle of rum and the yo-ho-ho
Keelhaul that filthy landlubber
Send him down to the depths below

I will not say what he has done
His sins are far too grave to tell
It's not my place to judge a man
But for them he will burn in hell
The sharks will dine up on his flesh
And Davy Jones will have his soul
Take his money and his hat
He won't need them where he's gonna go

But first, let's tie him to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

Keelhaul that filthy landlubber
Send him down to the depths below

Alestorm - Mexico



When the quest is over and the battle's won
There's a land far to the south where we go to have some fun
The wenches they are plenty, the alcohol is free
The party lasts all through the night and the alcohol is free

(woa-oh-oh)
Tonight we drink together
(woa-oh-oh)
Tomorrow we may die

Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus grow
Tequila and a donkey show
Mexico, Mexico
Yo ho Mexico
Far to the south where the cactus grow
Take me away from the ice and the snow
Let's go to Mexico

A pirate's life is simple
We drink and steal and kill
Always we are questing, in search of bigger thrills
We've sailed across the oceans, got drunk in many bars
But when we sail to Mexico that's where we party hard

Alestorm - No Grave but the Sea


Quest!
Set a course to the battle
Speed is our weapon of war
De Grasse will pay with his ichor
Blood, mutilation and gore
This is a mission of murder
Death is the freedom you crave
We are the agents of slaughter
Swift is the path to the grave

Breaking the line
Formidable rage
Raking their broadside with fire

Sail away, set sail into the blue horizon
Ride the waves, that guide our destiny
Sail away, today we fight and there will be
No mercy for those with no grave
No grave but the sea

Ride!
Now the winds are a-changing
Into the breach we will sail
Flanked by the Duke and the Bedford
Formidable charge cannot fail
Fire!
With a volley of grapeshot
Blood stains the ocean this day
We are the agents of slaughter
Swift is the path to the grave

Alestorm - Pirate Song


Though you see me now; the ghost of a man
I once had the heart of a lion
Commanding my ship, between many a shore
The ol' Jolly Roger a-flyin'
Mine was a name that struck fear into men
And regret into plenty o' lasses
Lo, how I wish I could take back those days
As I stare at these empty beer glasses

I think of the times past when I had it all
I toyed with men's wives and their daughters
And in my pursuit of this ill-gotten wealth
I stabbed and I slashed and I slaughtered

And for what? (hey!)
The men that I've fought
Are matched by the number of women I've bought
And for what? (hey!)
I've killed and I've shot
And reddened the cold tears of children with blood

And if I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
And kill every last one of those bastards, my friend!
You might also like
My ship was the last sight that many would see
As we narrowed the gap with our quarry
Sound of the cannons and splintering wood
Did herald our paths into glory
We seized all the bounty and scuppered the ship
Our hearts hadn't time for the wounded
I took my share and the crew got the rest
And on into port we then bounded

Life has many pleasures and we had our fill
Of food and of wenches and beer
When we tired of the port or had drunken it dry
The time to set sail had come near

And for what? (hey!)
We heeded no law
Made other men suffer so we can have more
And for what? (hey!)
We lived every day
The noose of the hangman a hairbreadth away

And if I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
And kill every last one of those bastards, my friend!

Oh, I have seen wonders you never have dreamed
And taken my fair share I must say
Holds full of booty I happily seized
From crews who would not see a new day
Spanish gold came and went, and gemstones were sold
But I knew more lay on the horizon
Yet the beer was too good, and gals were too sweet
And now in my old age, it's gone

These memories were bought with the lives of good men
A price that I paid without scruple
So many so suffered so I could get drunk
And swagger from brothel to brothel

And for what? (hey!)
It's been many years
The screams of the vanquished still ring in my ears
And for what? (hey!)
I've blood on my hands
I wait for my place in the halls of the damned!
And if I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one o' those bastards, my friends!

Alestorm - Scraping the Barrel


For many a-year we have travelled the seas
Singing songs about pirates and all their misdeeds
Stories of treasures and great undead foes
Just a day in the life of a man that I know
Your legendary prowess in drinking much beer
Recorded in song for all people to hear
But many have asked where we're next gonna sail
The answer lies deep in a barrel of ale

There are no more tales to be told
No more stories from battles of old
Now it seems our journey has come to an end
We are scraping the barrel my friend
There are no more tales to be told
No more stories from battles of old
Now it seems our journey has come to an end
We are scraping the barrel my friend

You may think you've heard all this music before
That Running Wild did it back in '84
But times are a-changing and we don't give a damn
So if you don't like it, go start your own band
Many have told us that we can't go on
That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs
But when the time comes to write album four
We'll scrape at the barrel once more

Alestorm - The Sunk'n Norwegian


There lies a tavern near Wisconsin Way
Where you can get drunk any time o' the day
The landlord's a bastard, the barmaid's a whore
But give them no shit or you're straight out the door

The Sunk'n Norwegian's the name of this hole
A nasty ol' tavern if ever I known

One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Scoundrels and brigands and ne'er-do-wells
And creatures dragged up from the black pits of Hell
You'll find your relief in a tankard of ale
So the Sunk'n Norwegian is where we will sail
You might also like
For barrels of whiskey or pints from the bar
But if you don't know
Then you don't go
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Drink up my friends, as much as you can
For tomorrow we sail! To a faraway land
We'll party all night and get drunk off our heads
Cause we can all rest when we are dead!
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Alestorm - To the End of the World


A codex of doom from a deep catacomb
A dusty old volume of lore
Hidden within this annal of sin
Confounding the doctrine of sphere
Science has lied since the dawn of mankind
This world is a fragment of four
3000 years of deception must end
Free from the shackles of time

Conjectural convolution
Exposing mathematical flaws
Armed with sedition and armored with truth
Lay waste to the doctrine of law

Ride into the storm
To the end of the world
Under the sign of the cube of time
Ride into the storm
Set fire to the sky
The truth will be told as the circle unfolds
Ride into the storm
To the end of the world

Ride into the storm
Defying the tide
Questing the seas with a vengeance

The time for execution, a harrowing display
For treachery upon the seas has taken place this day
Your final hour have begun
We‘ve all agreed your end has come
We‘ll take your sword, we‘ll take your gun
It‘s time for you to come undone

Be aware, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and pointy teeth

Walk the plank
With your life, you‘ll pay the price
Walk the plank
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the plank
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the plank
Descend into the black and don‘t come back


A nameless bay, in the mist
You have no right to exist
You‘ve got the captain really pissed
And so it‘s time you were dismissed
Give the line a little twist
And wrap the ropes around your wrist

When the moon's shining bright
My defender of kings we bow in sorrow
In the first morning light I'll call
On the eve of the fight we fall
My defender of kings, we rise tomorrow
In the wake of an army broken
In the words of a spell unspoken
My defender of kings
We bow and follow by your side
In the valley of the holy
In the valley of the holy
Set in fire
Battle in the sky
In the valley of the holy
In the dragons territory
For the kingdom and the glory
Set in fire
Battle in the sky

Bloodbound - Behind The Moon

Late at night you've locked the doors
There's the strangest feeling
Was that curtain really drawn before
Was that candle burning
Was that carpet torn
Had you really left those lights turned on
As you gaze into the gloom
And the windows mirror you
But the face reflected isn't yours
When the wind is howling
And the moon looks on
Can you really say your fears all gone
From dusk till dawn
The curse is on
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
As the shadows fade away
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
From behind the moon they come
In the pale blue light tonight
In the shadows, in the dark
Where the terrors of your mind take shape
There's no comfort here
When all is said and done
Can you really tell those lights weren't on
You might also likeFrom dusk till dawn
The curse is on
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
As the shadows fade away
With the light of day comes no sanctuary
From behind the moon they come

Bloodbound - Drop The Bomb

The time of the killing has come
Prepare for war
They're all around us
A life in the dark has begun
Behind the walls we die to live
Cry the ground
With holy water
Make a sound and hell is here
Drop the bomb
And we'll blow them all away
Dust and smoke
In a cloud filled with fear
Drop the bomb
And we'll send them back to hell
Mud and clay
Like an old catacomb
Drop the bomb
The crime of our time
Has been done
Destruction lives an evil story
A sanctuary under the sun
Behind the walls
We live to die
Cry the ground
With holy water
Make a sound and hell is here
Drop the bomb
And we'll blow them all away
Dust and smoke
In a cloud filled with fear
Drop the bomb
And we'll send them back to hell
Mud and clay

Bloodbound - Reign of Fire

Stories of magic, the ministrel sing
Of dragon lords and of witches and kings
In the hall of heroes where legends were born
A mind awakes to obey the lord
Closing my eyes and I dream of the fight
A warrior rise to unite
Tales of worlds forlorn under reign of fire
Spectres that rose from the flame
We're riders of the storm of the great empire
Sworn to protect and preserve
Cold winds rising with tidings of war
The wrath of darkened submission unfolds
In the hall of legends where heroes are born
A heart set sail to fulfill the oath
Shadows await in the dead of the night
A warrior rise to oblige
Tales of worlds forlorn under reign of fire
Spectres that rose from the flame

Bloodbound - Silver Wings

She was young she
Was cold and lonely
Never learned to fly
High above
The clouds are passing by
Don't belong
In the world of humans
Even if she try
High above
The clouds are growing darker
In the dead of night
When the time is right
Spread your wings in the moonlight
In her loneliness
Fire's sweet caress
Rider of the sky
Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings
You might also likeAll alone in the halls of darkness
Hide where eagles dare
Leave the cage it's time to find her wings
For as long as I can remember
She was born a master of the heavens
In the dead of night
When the time is right
Spread your wings in the moonlight
In her loneliness
Fire's sweet caress
Rider of the sky
Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings
Far away from heaven
I have lost all hope
All light in the dark
On the way to distant shores
I'm led astray
I turn to you and pray
Over the trees
Over mountains over seas
I will fly far away in a firestorm
Over the hills
Over valleys and the fields
I will burn everything
Under my silver wings

All for one and one for all
Say my friend misery
In the silence darkness takes control
Come with me to fading stars
A place without a name
Inner demons are creeping in my soul
We fly so far away
Still I hear 'em say
Come set fire to the sky
End of hope the world is darkening
Soaring wings the sky is closing in
Burning flames the day of reckoning
Tears of a dragon
End of days a world of ice again
Soaring wings the screams are all the same
Burning flames will never ease the pain
Tears of a dragonheart
Pray for one and pray for all
Say why this mystery
In the shadows I can see my fall
Fly with me to hell and back

And the light of the fire is all

And fly above the sky

With the banners held high

Heaven shall burn
In a cloud of fire

Wings of war are you ready to fight
Stand and fight
Darkness, the end of the world

Prophets in crystal and visions in mind
They're selling the seeds of their own vicious kind
And the tale of darkness prevails on and on
Wizards of magic and saver of souls
Planting the greed of their devious moles
And the spell of silver and sword takes me home

The price of your life in the palm of my hand

Leaving the shadows behind

Kelj fel, fiam, édes fiam
Jer velem, induljunk, menjünk haza!
Nem jöhet ő már többé haza
Nem láthatom soha
Szalmaszín haja, göndör haja

Úgy szerettelek, mint az fényes napot
És te emlékezni fogsz reám
Hallasz még rólam, édes rózsám
Hajnali szél szaván
Úgy szerettelek, mint az fényes napot
És te emlékezni fogsz reám

Dalriada - Napisten Hava

1 ContributorNapisten Hava LyricsNem fénylett még nap, se hold, sem csillagok
Hideg volt a föld, és sivár, üres pusztaság
Vad sem verte fel az éjnek menedékét
Nem bolygatta meg senki-semmi az Isten Atyát
Elbúsult fenti égi csarnok-palotában
Szólni vágyott Mindenek Ura, Ős-Öregisten
Könnyéből szórt éji égre csillagokat
Mosolyából nap lett meleg, és fény a hideg égen
Égbolt széléből letört lám, egy darabot
Vele formázta meg a szóval szóló gyermekét
Vízben hallal, erdei vaddal táplálta
S neki adta végül csillagok fénye, tűz melеgét
Dal szólalt meg, szél-virágok muzsikája
Nyár jött, édes, egеkig érő szava-násza
Így lett gazdája pusztának-rónának
Aranyos Szegletnek, e világ szép Hajnalának
Ott ül, fényes égi trónján
Nap Atyánk balján, Hold Anyánk jobbján
Nevetése széllel indul, velünk sír, ha könnyünk csordul
Áldj meg a Régiek szaván..You might also like

Dalriada - Nyárutó

1 ContributorNyárutó LyricsÍgy tért Atyáihoz az utolsó pogány besenyő
Száz csatában győztes, népet új hazába vezető
Szabad róna gyermeke, nem lázad többé, nyugton immár
Kopjafák helyett templomok állanak már
És a besenyők népe otthonra talál
Ne aludj el, két szememnek szép világa
Mert elindult ez földnek, ez égnek nagy királya
Sereggel jő, háta mögött kard és kereszt
Új hitre térít, Napunkhoz többé már nem ereszt
Pusztákon széllel szárnyaló, büszke sasok népe
Határok őre, az magyar földnek ékessége
Nem áldoz többé, nem imád többé Égi atyát
Kötve a szárnya, nem hallja már az Ősök dalát
Szó mit sem ér, győzelmet már fegyver sem hozhat
Fel kell hát venni jó népünknek az rabláncokat
Kereszténnyé, és alávetetté kell itt lennünk
Vagy hontalan, bús földönfutóként menekülnünk
Földi vezérünk, Vadkan apánk, besenyők csillaga
Állj ki és szólítsd lovas töményt az háborúba
Vagy nyugvást adjál, kereszt jelét magad is vedd fel
Hogy mi légyen a sorsunk, jó vezérünk, most döntened kell
You might also likeSem kereszttel, de Istenünkkel
Viharral éneklő Őseinkkel
Vélük leszek, meg nem tagadok
Égi Atyánk hitén maradok
Veres az ég tovafelé
Teremtőnk mosolyog errefelé
Lovamnak hátán temessetek
Testemen sírdombot emeljetek
Így tért Atyáihoz az utolsó pogány besenyő
Száz csatában győztes, népet új hazába vezető
Szabad róna gyermeke, nem lázad többé, nyugton immár
Kopjafák helyett templomok állanak már
És a besenyők népe otthonra talál
Így tért Atyáihoz az utolsó pogány besenyő
Száz csatában győztes, új hazába vezető
Szabad róna gyermeke, nem lázad többé, nyugton immár
Kopjafák helyett templomok állanak már
Végül Tonuzoba népe otthonra talál

Dalriada - Thury György balladája 1. rész

1 ContributorThury György balladája 1. rész LyricsHárom nap jött fel az égre, három baljóslatú jel
Nehéz időknek nagy vitézi ragyogtak, lám, e földön fel
Lándzsa, kard, és kopjatörés volt jó vitézlő oskola
Karddal védték így a békét, mezei legény, és katona
Kevés oly vitéz termett a világra,mint Thury György
Hálával emlegette a pogánytól elgyötört föld
Két bősz sas közt, egyik sem jobb, szenvedett a nemzetünk
Híres vitéz, végváraink csillaga volt Ő nekünk
"Zöldítsétek egek hamar az erdőket
Hogy próbálhassuk már nyugodt fegyverünket! "
Szabad ország, vérrel vett béke
Utódainknak öröksége
Ezért küzdünk, ennek élünk
Pusztul, romlik nemzedékünk
Áldozatunk nem hiába
Fény derül majd a hazára-
Beste pogánynak soha barátja nem voltam, nem leszek
Rongyos vitéz jómagam is, de mégis győzelmet veszek
Rajta legények, zsoldunk fogytán, csapjunk rájuk igazán
Víg örömmel, fegyverünkkel, forgolódjunk szaporán
Zöldüljön fel föld és erdő, adjon az ég most szép nyarat
Hadd forogjon hadi szerszámunk, ritkítsuk a pogányokat
Kontyos fejjel díszítjük fel végváraink kapuját
Hadd lássa meg, hadd tudja meg,eddig jöttél, ne tovább

Dope - My Funeral


Now as I lay here in the dark
And I think back to the start
I know some things have to end
For the next one to begin

I walk alone, free at last
I feel the pressure letting go
From the very bottom of my soul
Flesh and bone for the past
Like the ashes in the rain
And fade away

It's my funeral
Welcome you all
This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

Now as we stand two worlds apart
The time's hardened up my heart
From a world of no regrets
That I hope won't soon forget
You might also like
I walk the line on broken glass
I let the passion take control
Of the very bottom of my soul
Cross the line, fade to black
Hold the candle to the flame
And light the way

Welcome you all
This is the end of the line
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't want to leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

How many times should I stop and believe in myself
I don't believe much in anything
I've seen enough of the pain and the shame and the blame
It don't amount up to anything

Now I rewind back to a time
Where I would do anything and pay any price
And I need time 'cause I'm starting to think
That the promises ain't worth the sacrifice

And there's nothing for me here
There's nothing for me here

How many nights should I walk in my sleep
As I dream of how much I wanna run away
I've had enough of the stress and the mess
I can't take anymore, I gotta get away

Now I know why I'm empty inside
And I'm sure I've only got myself to blame
And I don't try to view the lies
It's just a waste of time, I'll never be the same

And I can't explain
When everyone's gone and I'm left holding the blame
And I can't rewind
And there's no escape
It's been so long and I just don't feel the same

Egypt Central - Dead Machine


I can’t find the pattern
The link in corrupted lines
At the heart of the matter
The system has failed inside
I’m left disconnected
The circle and a cycle spin
But the memories affected
They cripple the life within

I, I can’t fix how I’m wired
I, I am sick with the virus
Deep in the circuits
Like a dead machine

Cracks in the framework
Trace back to the crashing core
When I meet the maker
They have so much to answer for

I, I can’t fix how I’m wired
I, I am sick with the virus
Deep in the circuits

A light comes through the glass
And shines in on the past
The day you left too fast
The day I saw you last

A faded photograph
The time we thought we had
And I just want you back

Goodnight, goodnight
This pain won't last forever
I'll bury this, bury this inside
Please don't say goodbye
Goodnight, goodnight
It doesn't mean forever
I'll bury this, bury this inside
It's my last kiss goodnight

Egypt Central - Locked and Caged

Stuck inside these same four walls I've seen for sixteen years
I'm calling out and no one hears nothing is as it appears
Time is gonna pass me by the days are getting short
I feel my patience wearing thin waiting for this to begin
Locked inside my cage
(Chorus)
Would you be there to let me out
I can't take anymore
Just let me out
I can't take anymore
Choking on my selfish pride it's hard to swallow down
I swear I'd turn my life around if I could get out of this town
Every sacrifice I've made to help me get this far
I'm not about to turn away I don't care how long it takes
Locked inside my cage
(Chorus)

You think you know where the hell I've been

'Cause they don't even know where to begin
The mom and dad that I never had
Were just the first of the MIA
Had the teachers and the preachers and the coaches and counselors
But everybody faded away
Fake it sympathy, you don't care
Yeah there's hell on earth, I live there

You can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates

Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything

Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me

I used to think that this was perfect
And wish that it was never ending
But those days are gone forever
It's something I'm not missing
There's a force there's a voice in my head
Telling me to think
About the times that you were cruel and mean
And I don't care if you walk away
I'm here to stay and you need to hear

Godsmack - Cryin' Like a Bitch!!



Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
And long-lived what you thought you were
Time ain't on your side anymore, anymore

And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

I'm tougher than nails, I can promise you that
Step outta line, and you'll get bitch-slapped back
And you can run your little mouth all day
But the hand of God just smacked you back into yesterday

And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denying you were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You might also like
Blinded by your sacred, faded past times
Only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance
To prove that your arrogance
Is stronger than you'll ever be...
It's stronger than you can be
Oh, stronger than you can be
Oh, stronger than you can
Be

And so you tell me I can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch
And you wonder why no one can stand you
There's no denyin' you were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
Oh, bitch

Godsmack - I Stand Alone


I've told you this once before:
Can't control me
If you try to take me down
You're gonna break
I feel your every nothing
That you're doin' for me
I'm thinking you oughta
Make your own way

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Stand alone, stand alone...

You're always hiding behind
Your so-called goddess
So, what? You don't think
That we can see your face?
Resurrected back before
The final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way
You might also like
I'm not afraid of fading...

Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

And now it's my time (Now it's my time)
It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)
Dream of the skies (Dream of the skies)
Make me believe that this place
Isn't plagued by the poison in me
And help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me

I stand alone inside
I stand alone
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone inside
I stand alone inside

Godsmack - Love-Hate-Sex-Pain


In this life, I'm me, just sitting here alone
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there for you
Walk the silent emptiness that leads me by my hands
And throw away what I don't understand as a man

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's underestimated lies

And I wonder as I tear away my skin
It's taken me so long to stitch these wounds from where I've been
And, Mother, please don't bury me, I'm begging for my life
It's hard to say that I will be complete before I die

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's underestimated lies

Don't you worry, please
Don't you leave me
Because I surely slip away
Though love, hate, sex, and pain
I fall away into
Love, hate, sex, and pain

Legs are tired, these hands are broken
Alone, I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall, the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall, the legends rise

My throat is dry, my vision's fading
I'm paralyzed and left here waiting
Taking time, just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall, the legends rise
We burned it out a mile wide
When ashes fall, the legends rise

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks, there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river, reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

We're blood brothers

Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Iron Maiden - Hallowed Be Thy Name


I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?


As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, "God be with you"
If there's a God, why has He let me go?
As I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
You might also like
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone

Iron Maiden - The Number of the Beast


Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah

Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards, attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall

In a foreign field, he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words, he prays
Tell the world of Passchendaele
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood-filled trench
Killing time till my very own death
On my face, I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts, and more gunfire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield: nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers, eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death, it overflows
In no-man's-land, God only knows
Into jaws of death, we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops, they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Passchendaele


Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Passchendaele


Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer, symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry, but no one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Passchendaele

Iron Maiden - Wasted Years


From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travelin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is?
You never miss it till it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be till my dying day

So, understand
Don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize
You're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky
You might also like
So, understand
Don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize
You're living in the golden years

So, understand
Don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize
You're living in the golden years
So, understand
Don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize
You're living in the golden years

Iron Maiden - Stratego


How do you read a madman's mind?
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more than you bargained for
Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation upon my soul

For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
There’s no surprise

Ocean is black, the Devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden, but I can’t explain
A cross to bear, a heavy faith
My sorrow whispers, "Time again"

I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me I'm almost there
The pain almost too much to bear
You might also like
I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing listened far too long
Little by little, eat away
I think I've lost my mind
Too late to change now what I left behind

Hear me, listen my call
I am ready to fall
Lord, hear me now
Let me go


Ocean is black, the Devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden, but I can't explain
A cross to bear, a heavy faith
My sorrow whispers, "Time again"

(Intro)
Material girl
In a material world

Diamonds not gone fade
Cause she paid up
And she keep it raw

Be the sailor
Ride a different wave with me baby

The Lost Fingers - Black Velvet

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmie Rodgers on the victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with a baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon, what could you do?

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm  begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene,  Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With  flaming locks of auburn hair
With  ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your  voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there is nothing I can do
To  keep from crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You might also like
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Let's go

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man

New Years Day - Defame Me


I'm not afraid to crawl through thick and thin
If only you noticed
If only you could see
The struggle, the silence
I'm not afraid to bleed
Just let the past go, it's ancient history

If you keep shutting me out, it's gonna haunt you
And when you choke on your words...

Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
Don't you go and make a scene!

With you or without you misfortune finds its way
You're with me or against me, I refuse to wait
I wound up giving everything and now I want nothing to do with you
Now you're choking on your words
You might also like
Don't you go and make a scene

I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene

Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
Don't you go and make a scene!

Go ahead, blame me
You can't defame me
Get it all out of your system
Go ahead and hate me, I don't care!

If you keep shutting me out, it's gonna haunt you
And when you choke on your words...

Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
Don't you go and make a scene!

New Years Day - Epidemic


We are the new disease eating hearts like cancer
The sickness in our mind believes everything
Plagued by fiction like a sick addiction
There's a virus deep inside us and it kills

Can you taste it in the blood when you breathe it in your lungs?
If you feel it coming on, it's too late

We are infected and no one is protected
(We're so, we're so contagious)
We're apathetic and no one's sympathetic
(We're so contagious)
You can't contain it
You know, you can't escape it
(We're so, we're so contagious)
Our hearts betrayed us and no one's gonna save us
(We're so contagious)

When will someone admit it?
We're a generation of cynics
When everyone's a critic
And no one really gives a shit
(When our hate goes viral)
If ignorance is bliss, how do we live like this?
There's nothing we can do
To try and take control when it spreads to your soul
You might also like
Can you taste it in the blood when you breathe it in your lungs?

(We're so contagious)
You can't contain it
You know, you can't escape it
(We're so, we're so contagious)
Our hearts betrayed us and no one's gonna save us
(We're so contagious)

There's no cure for what´s in us
So pessimistic, quick to judge
Now there's poison on our tongues
This epidemic's gonna kill us all

We are infected and no one is protected
(We're so, we're so contagious)
We're apathetic and no one's sympathetic
(We're so contagious)
You can't contain it
You know, you can't escape it
(We're so, we're so contagious)
Our hearts betrayed us and no one´s gonna save us
(We're so contagious)
It´s gonna kill us all
It's so contagious

New Years Day - I'm About To Break You


I can't be the blame
For the reasons you're in pain
If you push or pull away
But in the moment when it's over
Don't hold on here's closure

I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight, you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now - this is it

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

I'm not the one you built up
I'm not the dreams in your head
I will take what I want
And leave you tortured instead
Caught inside another trapped I've set
I look distressed
But I'm pretending to care
You might also like
I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight, you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now - this is it

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

Hasn't always been this way
Been the prey but I escaped
Cross my heart and lick my scars
Play with me, get ripped apart

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can doesn't mean that I will
I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

(I'll turn to something you won't like)
But I'm about to break you

New Years Day - Kill Or Be Killed


Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed
Kill or be killed...

Your imagination gets so twisted when you
Think you've seen my worst but
I have an instinct that can never be reversed
My vengeance is a curse

I want to watch you bleed
You're the crime but I'm the scene

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed!
No other choice than "blood's gonna spill"
Back against the wall so
Forget and forgive!
But after all this I never will

Don't be ashamed of all the monsters in your head
All of us are
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
You might also like
I want to watch you bleed
You're the crime but I'm the scene

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed!
No other choice than "blood's gonna spill"

Forget and forgive!
But after all this I never will

Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are...
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
My sanity slid far from me
Provoked by rage it's driven me insane

Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed!
No other choice than "blood's gonna spill"
Back against the wall so
Forget and forgive!
But after all this I never will
Back against the wall so
It's kill or be killed!
No other choice than "blood's gonna spill"
Back against the wall so
Forget and forgive!
But after all this I never will
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!
Sick! Sick! All of us are sick!

New Years Day - Malevolence

So soft, so gentle
This rose is kind and still
With change comes hatred
Now time to kill
I've heard it all
I know I cared too much
But It's cruel to let you die
I'll take the fall
I'll be the heartless one
My veins are made of ice
Well I'm not afraid
To take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all
Then no one will
Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see
Has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done
I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me
You fool!
You might also likeIntentions once pure and simple
Now sinister and sharp
I was weak I would fall for a promise
I had no guard
Been through the worst
I've seen the purest soul
Fill up with such disdain
Watching them fall
Trying to take me out
I see your foolish games
Well I'm not afraid
To take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all
Then no one will
Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see
Has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done
I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me
Rotten to the core
Sacred vows are torn
Can't expect a snake to be a sheep
Can't expect a liar not to cheat
Rotten to the core
Sacred vows are torn
Can't expect a snake to be a sheep
Can't expect a liar not to cheat

Here's a chance to show you how I feel
A chance for you to see it's real
To see just what I feel inside and who it is that's by my side
I will never change my mind
Try to torch me and you'll find
You can't turn me or deter me
No matter how you try
You can't burn me
I know where I stand and what'll happen if you try it
I am fireproof
I know my heart and I just can't deny it
I am fireproof
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet
I am fireproof
I'll never bow down and you won't buy it
I am fireproof
Now you know what I'm all about
There's no chance I'll ever doubt
The only One who can control me
I extol the Almighty
You want me to put it on the line
And give yield to you this time
See but I won't compromise and I realize
It's my time to rise
It's my time to rise

It's like I'm walkin' alone into the valley of the shadow of death
Stand beside one another, cause it ain't over yet
I'd be willing to bet that if we don't back down
You and I'll be the ones that are holding the crown in the end
When it's over, we can say well done
But not yet cause it's only begun
So pick up and follow me, we're the only ones
To fight this thing until we've won
We drive on and don't look back
It doesn't mean we can't learn from our past
And all the things that we might've done wrong
We could've been doing this all along

Everybody with your fist raised high
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside
From the frontline
Everybody with your fist raised high
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside
From the frontline

And we'll be carrying on until the day it doesn't matter anymore
Step aside, if you forgot what this is for
We fight to live we live to fight
And tonight you'll hear my battle cry
We live our lives on the frontlines
We're not afraid of the fast times
These days have opened up my eyes
And now I see where the threat lies

Cut me like those words you throw
Console me when you want control
Roll me in those lies you've told
But I won't play these games no more and

It's taking everything I know

I'm about ready to blow

When I get angry, I feel weak
And hear these voices in my head
Telling me to fall beneath
'Cause they'll make everything okay
How did I get here?
Everything's unclear

Send me a lifeline

It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look

And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb

You'll always be two steps behind me
Outside these streets are cold as ice
Never thought I'd have the chance to come alive again
See through your eyes again (it takes me away)
And I've never waited in my life
Like I did when I stand under Your sky again
Try again

Hold on for a second
If words can be weapons
Then what I say can affect it
They're not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective

If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cause light shines brighter in the dark
You might also like
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment
If we're not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it
We just plant the seed and keep groanin'
And when that light shines in the mornin'
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'
We'll be smilin' like we expected
Sweet victory, one method

'Cause one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart

The Rasmus - Livin' in a World Without You


It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralyzed my body with a poisoned kiss
For forty days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom came alive
Livin' in a world without you

You told me, "My darling
Without me, you're nothing"
You taught me, to look in your eyes
And fed me, your sweet lies

Suddenly someone was there in the window
Looking outside at the sky that had never been blue

Oh oh oh oh
There's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh oh oh oh
There is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

You put me, together
Then trashed me, for pleasure
You used me, again and again
Abused me, confused me

Suddenly naked, I run through your garden
Right through the gates of the past and I'm finally free

Darkest cloud
Endless storm

Tearing down the spring

The Rasmus - Paradise

I'm dead, but I'm living
I played a part I've been given
I'm still kicked out of heaven
I'm into nothing new
Everyday is a battle
I made a deal with the devil
And I'm deep into trouble
So tired
I was trying to find a better way but every day's the same
I'm trying to break the numbness and it's driving me insane
You could be my saviour, you could be just what I need
So I lay down and pray for something better
Go ahead and leave me paralyzed
There's nothing left to sacrifice
In hell I'm shooting paradise
I'm ready so I'll close my eyes
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
It's gonna hurt but I'm ready
It's clear where I'm heading
Don't call paramedics
I'm into nothing new
I'll be gone in a minute

Æther Realm - Goodbye


I fell asleep with the candle burning
Another dream; a break in the light
I have always known
You don't need my hand to guide you
So push forward alone
Into the heart of the great unknown

You give me bad, bad dreams
And they just ain't quittin'
And I've been reading the signs
I wrote a melody and I just can't hit it
Feels like I'm livin' a lie
And when I lay my head beside you
It's not my kinda life
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Pierce my eyes in your search for a better view
And hope the pain stays fresh when I think of you
I have only wished you to heed the voice inside you
And be whole within yourself
Don't make me an enemy, savor the memory

You give me bad, bad dreams
And they just ain't quittin'
And I've been reading the signs

Æther Realm - Slave to the Riff


I'm just another fucking slave

It's 3 am I should get some sleep
Balled up notes scattered at my feet
Chasing a feeling that I haven't felt
Since way back when
I held the foolish hope
That this would bring me peace

It's not enough, never
A voice insists I have to try to make it better
But better's never there
It's a ghost of a sound getting farther away
Diverged from the path, and it lead me astray

The feeling it haunts me, eternally calling
It won't let me rest, and it won't let me forget
I'm just a slave to the riff
I'm just another fuckin slave

Signed and sealed in blood and sweat
All it costs is a soul? I barely have one left
I feel the sorrow cutting deeper and I can't resist
Now won't you just give it to me?
I've bled for this
You might also like
Are you sure? I can grant what you seek
But you will be forever changed
You may not like what you become.....very well

But only for a moment

Æther Realm - The Magician

Alone on the ancient mountaintop
Stood the one who had lost his way
For when you walk on the path of a traitor
You will find you may soon be betrayed
Stray not from the path you've chosen
You may yet find what you seek
You will learn to command the ethereal realm
And fulfill your destiny
Cast out of his land for reaching for that which lies out of mortal sight
Like a beast he is feared and hunted
Like a beast he intends to fight
Stay true to your heart young warrior
Keep your sword close by your side
And when night comes again beware what the darkness hides
Go now to the realm of spirits child
You are running out of time
Seek quickly the one who will guide you
Who will teach you the way of light
Doubt not your resolve young wanderer
May your stride be swift and true
For the colors of day are fading away
And tonight they will come for you
No amount of work or training
Can prepare you for the changing winds
But don't despair my child
You must fight
Take hold of strength divine
Shape the world to your design
And release the power you keep inside your heart
You might also likeI am the light when a life's at its end
The still burning candle when darkness descends
I am desire, warmth from the fire
Fueling your steps when your journey began
I am the fear twisting tight round your throat
The life giving spark hiding deep in your soul
I am your aura, hunger for honor
I hold the power you seek
Eeeeyuh
A fire arose behind his eyes
The trees, like torches, blazed up in the night
The fire raced across the sky
The trees like torches
Like torches blazed with light
And now they're on the run
No mercy smite them one by one
You've got an axe to grind
Relentless, no one left behind
Immolation is their fate
Hunt them down and let them feel your hate
No cowards left alive
By your power they will die
And now they're on the run
No mercy smite them one by one
You've got an axe to grind
For the fire of your soul
Is a terror to behold
No amount of work or training
Can prepare them for their flaming end
But don't hold back my child
They must die
Take hold of strength divine
Shape the world to your design
And release the power you keep inside your heart

Amon Amarth - Raise Your Horns


Victory, we fought hard and prevailed
Brutally, we were fighting
Stormy seas, rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield, lit by lightning
Eagerly, we filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily, ravens cawing
Home shore calls, we return on bloody seas
Twilight falls, darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets, we went out to war and strife
To protect, king and country
Victory, honour those who gave their life
Willingly, we will not grieve

My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames
I march against the asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name

Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!
Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!
Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise

Their faces hard as stone
They have come to take farewell
In silence they mourn

"Our king has left our ranks
A wise and noble man
We owe him loyalty and thanks
He ruled with a steady hand
He will be missed by all
His heart has now been stilled
Tonight he'll dine in Odin's Hall
There he'll drink his fill"

And sink into the depth

And when the morning breaks
Our king has left this world to walk
Through Valhalla's gates

As I get closer, my dreams get farther
I climb that ladder, but you kick it over
Thirsty for water, you give me vinegar
When I drink your medicine, it just makes me sicker

I dug a hole so deep
I’m gonna drown in my mistakes
Can’t even sell my soul
‘Cause it ain’t worth shit to take

I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)
And I just can’t sink any lower (Lower and lower)
The hounds of hell are getting closer (Closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)

Follow the rainbow, my lucky omen
There ain’t no pot of gold, just copper tokens
I found the key to life, the lock was broken
All my accomplishments are best left unspoken

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldn't find at home

Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down

I'd ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks
Hiding my track marks
I left my best friends
Or did they just leave me?

They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

Billy Talent - Red Flag


Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well, I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is the minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two
Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
Then the hunt will be on for you

The red flag waving never meant the same, no
The red flag waving never meant the same

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain

The red flag waving never meant the same, no
The red flag waving never meant the same, go!

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same

Billy Talent - Rusted From The Rain


I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There’s nothing left to salvage, no one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors I don’t look the same
I’m rusted from the rain, I’m rusted from the rain

Dissect me ’til my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I’m nothing but a tin man, don’t feel any pain
I don’t feel any pain, I don’t feel any pain
I’m rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I’m the King of cowards
You’re the Queen of pain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I’m just a frame
I used to be a lap dog, now I’m just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay
I’m rusted from the rain

Billy Talent - Viking Death March


Down, let's take it down – raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy on evolution's mistake
Change will have to wait, if we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets and their doomsday charade
You preach about love and teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock – punch it with all of your rage
Put the man in office for a minimum wage
Rats, fighting for scraps, siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty, as they laugh to the bank
They speak about trust but make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Now, the time is now, we can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon, 'til they fall to the ground
Light, let there be light without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until salvation is found
So how can you look the world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Crackin' the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls

Beast in Black - Blind and Frozen


Once I touched your heart
Held you in closed arms
Built a haven for your love
Until I let you fall apart
Please forgive me

God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me
How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love

My forlorn heart faintly beats
Your absence makes me weak
And if nothing brings you back
Surely I'll roam through life in black
Like a shadow

Destiny, is this how it should be? No no no!

Beast in Black - Blood of a Lion


Maybe this is the end
Or a brave new beginning
At a crossroad of life
There’s a choice to be made
By a restless heart
But the heart finds its way
In the shadows of doubt
If you carefully listen
It whispers to you
And you will know soon

Blood of a lion
Blood of the beast makes you who you are
Blood of a lion
Many will stand against you
But you will prevail and reclaim
Your crown and throne

With the cage now destroyed (now destroyed)
Let the sheep feel your presence
And you will storm the castle
With a thundering roar for victory
Your time has come

Equal in strength

Abysmal oceans roar
With immortal hate
Imbued with blistering rage
You will ride the wave

Fight until you
Die by the blade of the one you hate

End of the game
Die by the blade of the one you love to hate

A spectacle beyond all dreams
Deafens the cries and screams
Feast your eyes on the cursed gift from God

You can't take away the love
We won't regret what we have hoped

Beyond The Black - Echo from the Past

Forgotten doesn't mean forgiven
I feel sinister eyes
Embraced with fear I dare to wonder
If love's a lie
A yelling choir breaks the silence
Where peace seemed to prevail
How long am I to stand another bale?
Too much time I locked the truth away
Too much time until my judgement day
Can you hear the echo
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Forgotten doesn't mean forgiven
No more I have a choice
It screams at me all day and night
The omniscient voice
You might also likeMy demons journeyed through the ages
They haunt me in my dreams
May I surrender to my destiny
Too much time I locked the truth away
Too much time until my judgement day
Can you hear the echo
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?
Can you hear the echo from the past?
And when the light of hope surrounds me
I can't escape the undertow
Drawing me back into the dark from long ago
There will be no more sweet tomorrow
No more savior on my way
I invoked the nightmares of my yesterdays
Can you hear the echo
Can you hear the echo from the past?
Can you hear the echo
Arisen from an ancient vast?
Can you hear the echo?
And I'm letting go, the die is cast
I've got to face a dark arcanum
Am I the one to breathe my last?
Can you hear the echo?
Can you hear the echo?
Can you hear the echo from the past?

Beyond The Black - Fairytale of Doom

Blinded by gold and blinded by diamonds
I let you chain me in silk
You told me lies, I drowned in your eyes
And in all those castles you built
Silver the treasure and gold in the cages
Nothing was quite as it seemed
And when I realized, you turned the key in
And I saw your eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed
Once upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you
We spoke vows to last forever, oh
Once upon a time I lived a dream
I got blinded by your scheme
Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom
Feeding on nightmares, stealing my terror
You enjoy keeping me here
I feel it slipping, I see it dripping
Like blood and tears you drink fear
Silver the treasure and gold in the cages
And when I backed here you gleamed
Laughing with pleasure
Stealing my terror
I saw your eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed
You might also likeOnce upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you

Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom
Riven my soul and riven my senses
I feel my spirits recede
Dying imprisoned, last of my visions
Your burning eyes full of greed
It was too late when I screamed
Once upon a time this love was true
And I tied myself to you
We spoke vows to last forever, oh
Once upon a time I lived a dream
I got blinded by your scheme
Still my vows hold me forever
In a fairy tale of doom

Beyond The Black - Fall into the Flames


The darkest night, can't close my eyes
Sleep is weak
I'm hypnotized, it's do or die
I feel your heat

I think it's time to tear through these chains

We're gonna fall into the flames and everglow
Yeah, we're gonna fall into the flames, I feel the smoke
Breathe it in, we can't stop, there's no running
Can't stop, almost burning
Fall into the flames and everglow
You're my everglow

I see the fire spread, two silhouettes
Sinking deep, inside my chest is a world below
They say we're self-destructing
But hell we gotta do something
Nothing, oh nothing
Doin' nothing

Is never gonna break through these chains

Beyond The Black - Forget My Name


The autumn trees have shed their leaves
A cloudy sky is riddled with your grief
Don't watch me go out in the rain
The days we lost will never come again
I'll disappear, like morning mist
May our dream be captured in a kiss
To find us once and wake us then
Don't ask me now
The wind alone knows when

Forget my name
Forget my name and let me die

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
All my sins, forgiven
All my soul is riven
Nothing left – no tears to cry
All is lost, forsaken – torn apart
Forget my name my love and let me die
Forget my name

How dark is the night, how deep your pain
The hurt you feel will never be in vain
You raised me high into the sun
Live in the past if there's no moving on
There is no fight, just destiny
No one to blame, to set your sorrow free
New home will come, you'll find a way
Wish me farewell, there's nothing else to say

Wash away your sadness
Break the chains of grief
Keep your faith together
In the past you'll find relief

Forget my name
Forget my name and let me die
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
All my sins, forgiven

Beyond The Black - In the Shadows


Now we’re standing here together
At the crystal borderline
All my memories are shattered
Nothing’s left of what was mine
I’m tryin’ to hold you
But you slip away
A candle cannot burn forever
To whom am I to pray

Up we rise into the night
We’ll never die in the shadows
We can break out of these days
Darkness will blaze in the shadows
Our kingdom will come
When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise into the night
We’ll never die in the shadows

It’s so hard to kill the demons
When they live inside your heart
Don’t give up to find your fortune
When you don’t know where to start
So come here and take me
I’m already gone
In a second life beside you
Is where I want to belong

We can break out of these days

When our dreams can grow wild
Up we rise into the night
We’ll never die in the shadows

Beyond The Black - Lost in Forever


Another daybreak
Another dawn to waste away
Another struggle in vain
Out of the empty
From out the void to die again
What is the reason to gain?

Somebody let me out, I'll pay the toll
Somebody free me from this hell
And deliver my soul

Lost in forever (ever, ever, ever)
In a world of shattered skies
I am reaching for my life
Lost in forever (ever, ever, ever)
While the centuries fall apart
I am searching for my heart
Lost in forever

Is this a nightmare?
Am I in someone else's dream
Give me a soul to redeem
Is this the after?
An ever endless world of pain
To drive the faithful insane

Beyond The Black - Numb

Incipe memoriam
Incipe abicere
Desiste ab memoria
Let me go numb
Omitte nunc dolores
Quid agis nihil moror
Retineri non possum
Let me go numb
You were so good a liar
And I was so in love
That I invited in the pain
I had to learn with fire
After a flame is snuffed
Only the ashes still remain
Now that I fin’ly see you
As you are
Must I be forced to see you
In every scar?
Practicing blackest magic
You cast a spell on me
That even today is hard to break
While it was turning tragic
Part of me stayed deceived
Part me clung to my mistake

Make a new life

Beyond The Black - Parade

I face it each morning
I see myself and wonder why
The mirror would haunt me
And wants to show the things I hide
I feel like I'm naked
And the world is watching to the bone
Consuming my power
And it sometimes feels - I'm on my own
We hide behind
Facades of light
That leave us blind
Don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be in the race
I don't wanna walk the parade
Don't wanna be someone, be someone else
Don't judge me, don't change me
I wanna be who I am
Don't want to walk the parade
We serve and deliver
And claim to be the justified
Our values are shattered
While we surrender our pride

I don't wanna give in
I don't care what they think
If anything is real then love is
There is a world full of joy
And it's easy to share
Just be yourself and feel what I feel
Don't wanna walk the parade

Watch you spin in your veils of protection
Layer on layer of dark colors unwind
Shake them off but you never forget them
Show your scars to the mute and the blind
Only showin' your face to the lonely
Wear a mask for the masses so cold
Choosin' roads that are broken and stony
Let me tell you my dreams of our destiny
Speak to me, sing to me, bare your soul to me
Step through the mirror, join me inside
Run to me, stay with me, till eternity
Show me the face that you hide
You hide, oh
You are wandering spaces in limbo
Hearin' words from the voice in your head
Give a sign and I'll open the window

I got lost in the dark on the trail of your fading heart
All these dreams left to die on our way to a broken sky
I see what we left and the bridge is about to burn

You are far, but somehow you’re still holding the darkness out

Beyond The Black - Shine and Shade


We live in shine and shade
And trust the bittersweet
But a fool who doesn't see
How precious life can be
Each triumph has a lonely side
We're always facing black and white
We're heading for the bittersweet
Each curtain call a daring deed
A way to go, can be a way to fall
We might lose it when we want it all
We're living in the shine and shade
We're swaying between love and hate

Oh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown

A disharmonic harmony
Completing our symphony
More can be more or can be less
No difference between life and death

Oh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown
Don't waste it onto barren land

We live in shine and shade

We're hoping for the best to come
And forget about what we have done
Forget about what we achieved
The fortunes and the miseries
We live a lonely life together
Close and yet so far forever
Along the way we see it all
We know the rise
We know the fall

Oh, let a child be a child
Before the seed is sown
Don't waste it onto barren land
We're gonna shine on

Beyond The Black - Dancing in the Dark


When all things lead to a dead end
A point of no return
When nothing's left but to stand back
And watch the fire burn
I won't surrender my spirit
I won't give up my life
I'll live this day to the last breath
With you all by my side

We've been fighting so hard
When all things must perish
And the heavens fall apart, and the heavens fall apart

No tomorrow, no regret

For tomorrow we'll be dead
No fear, no pain
No grief diggin' in my head

And we will live it loud

Beyond The Black - Reincarnation


I see a trail there, leadin' back through centuries
I feel connections, like the roots below the trees
Whatever tells me I know you from before
It feels like dyin' was just another door

I never cared for the stories they tell
I never thought about heaven and hell
I just remember a life in the past
A life that I lost

(It's like a) Reincarnation, saved from the dead
(It's like a) Reincarnation, life takes us back
(Remember) We'll be forever, endless as time
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die

Watch me fly
(My soul up to the sky)
Watch me fly
(It's not my time to die)
Watch me fly
(The dark you see will fade)
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die
You might also like
I'm full of memories from a time I wasn't born
My life, a fraction of a unity that's torn
It all reminds me that there is more than this
Signs over time now that I just can't dismiss

I never cared for the stories they tell
I never thought about heaven and hell
I just remember a life in the past
A life that I lost

(It's like a) Reincarnation, saved from the dead
(It's like a) Reincarnation, life takes us back
(Remember) We'll be forever, endless as time
(It's like a) Reincarnation
My soul won't die

Beyond The Black - Free Me


You have held my hand in shiver
You have felt my tainted heart
You have witnessed how I wither
Fading slowly into dark

And you've walked into the silence
Where my hope has lost it's voice
I have one thing left to ask for
Grant me this, my final choice

Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me

Just as much as I adore you
I have fought with all my heart
Now the last time I implore you
Means to lay down all your arms

Will you find this strength within you
Will you help me, I must know
Wе have dreamt a dream togеther
Hold me close and let me go
You might also like
Free me, free me

To save me from drowning - now
I'm losing my mind here - now
The shadows upon me still grow
The fighting is over - now
Release me from evil - now
Come hold me at last and let go


You have walked into the silence
Where my heartbeat used to be
May the love your eyes still show me
Be the last thing that I see
That I see
So

Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me, free me
My love, I want you
Free me, free me
Free me, free me
My love, I want you
To free me

Beyond The Black - Wide Awake


Some kind of curse lies on this place
Where she is bound to live her lonely days
A hundred years may come and pass
Before the roses wither down at last
She's waited long, too long to say
And never fought the force that makes her stay
Some kind of curse lies on this place
And to her silent room she says

In a world out of time out of space
In a prison of thorns and disgrace
I will never surrender my mind
I will follow the path back to life
'Cause I'm wide awake
Oh so wide awake
I will follow the path back to life
And I'll survive

Into the dark of sprawling plants
She rips the vines apart with her bare hands
Her fingers bleed, she cannot see
She only feels her longing to be free
Where is the light, where is the day
A million thorns are fighting her to stay
Some kind of curse lies on this place
And with a trembling voice she says
You might also like

There're signs in the water, there're signs in the wind
It's easy to see if you dare
For once close your eyes now and open your mind
And you'll see the truth everywhere

A world full of cynics, filled up with hate
A mankind with nowhere to go
Once born in the fire, we keep up the flame
The world may be dying, but not in our name

Not in our name, not in our name
We call for reason, we're calling in vain
Not in our name, not in our name
Somеday you'll wake up and look back in shame
No, not in our name

Wе've come through the ages, we've gone through the times
And passed our legacy on
For once close your eyes now and search for what's real
The truth that's been there all along

A world full of shadows, filled with despair
A mankind that preys on the weak
The vultures are craving for more of the same

Standing tall 'til the end

We call for reason, we're calling in vain
Not in our name, not in our name
Someday you'll wake up and look back in shame

Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now
Are you running away?
I come apart
As I lie in your way
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to hurt
Nothing left to live

Face the monster I've become
I'm falling down
Hate won't let me go
In the ground, we rise to burn
I'm caving in
Life won't let me live
Forgive my heart

It's over now
I come apart
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down

Brothers of Metal - Death of the God of Light


Out on the fields where the lonely horizon lies
So cold to the touch, every valley is made of ice
Fairest of gods, he was forced to be put on trials
Facing his end staring into the trickster’s eyes

Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow
They all were repelled, no matter the might
Nothing could harm him now

God of light so wise and strong, the fairest of them all
His downfall was a mistletoe, now hope is bound to fall
Loki's plan so evil and so vicious in its way
Now only tears can save the worlds from Ragnarök's dismay

In search for the truth, he came up with a grand disguise
One conversation that lit up his evil eyes
For Loki, the envy was too much for him to bear
A secret revealed of a flower with skills so rare

Metal and steel, fire and ice
Was thrown at his naked brow

Brothers of Metal - Emblas Saga


Ek dreyma umb eldr
Ek dreyma umb dauðl
Hvar stjornur hrjóða grima himinn
Eldr ok dauðl - myrkr ok rauða
Tveir andill þú hafa
O grima þǫgn

In the beginning there was only darkness
Of icy mist and smoke
A darkness so completely dark
By war and death invoked
Sparkling flames would dare to reach
Across the arid void
And melt the rim of ice and frost
That framed it from the north
Oh, the birth of gods, the fall of foes
Oh, children of the tree
Now listen close, and hear the truth
Of how you came to be

First was the giant, Ymir his name
Then the cow Auðumbla, out of the melting ice they came
From Ymirs' palm another pair of giants, born and bred
Then left and right, his feet would mate to birth a child with several heads
You might also like
Auðumbla fed on frost in all her pride and grace
She woke the very first of gods by licking on his face
She ate away the icy cage that held him in his fury
A man of beauty and of might by the name of Burí

Burí somehow got a son, who somehow got a wife
Burí, Borr and Bestla – the avengers of their time
Then Bestla bore the children who made this story true
Vile, Ve and Odin – who created me and you

Memories will fade from man
The snow of death will fall upon
The children of Wodan
Distant echoes, whispering
Of how it all began
For the children of Wodan

Three were the brothers, three were the gods
In a world of giants, conspiring how to turn the odds
They slayed the very oldest, the one who was the first
Within the flowing blood - every giant was submerged
These waters of decay would never cease to flow
Creating every sea and every river that we know
And while the giants drowned, the gods got the idea
To take the corpse of Ymir and make the earth appear

His body would become the soil, his skull became the sky
And then they threw his giant brains aloft to form the clouds
His teeth became the rocks, they made mountains from his bones
And on the meadows through his hair the summer breeze was blown

Out of the ashes and into the light
The dead will make room for the living
Deep in the darkest of nights
The end is another beginning

The fire in my dreams
The death so long foreseen
The darkest sky
Adorned by lights
What does it hide?

Out of the ashes rise
The glowing seed of life
The darkest sky
Two faces hides
Oh, silent night

When the gods were done
They took a little break
A stroll upon the beach
To take a breath and contemplate

Two logs of ash and elm
Lay stranded on the shore
The children of the forest
The children of the gods

From dead to animated
And no longer adrift
For like the fairy godmothers
They gave them special gifts

The first would grant them spirit
And life beyond the plant
The second gave them movement
And the wit to understand
The third would give them faces
Their hearing and their sight
And thus the very first of humans
Were brought to life

Memories will fade from man
The snow of death will fall upon
The children of Wodan
Distant echoes, whispering
Of how it all began
For the children of Wodan

Far to the north
Through the ice and snow
There's a realm in the dark of the underground
Hidden deep below
Where we all must go
Is the land of the dead and the frozen

Master of the underworld, the queen of twilight
Sovereign of the mortals, she will claim your soul
The mistress of the void
With your death in her mighty grasp
When your path is at its' end

Goddess of the underground
Who's to blame
For the pain of the wicked
Helbound in her lonely crown
And only the one eyed knows why

Grima

A monster in their eyes
She was thrown from the skies
In her fall she was crippled and broken
Creating a fiend
It was easy enough
With a beast in control of the harness

Deceived by them all
She was crowned in her hall
As the mother of the sick and unchosen

Master of the underworld, the queen of twilight
Sovereign of the living, she will claim your soul
The mistress of the void
With your death in her mighty grasp
When your path is at its' end

Goddess of the underground
Who's to blame
For the pain of the wicked?
Helbound in her lonely crown
And only the one eyed knows why
There is no escape
The gods will end up dead
Go through the gates of Hel
And to the lordess of decay

The path that I am walking
Leads astray
And the mead I'm drinking takes
Me nowhere
Spirit and heart lost in time
Who am I now?

When the fire inside burns into nothingness
And your hammer-wielding fails you
Remember the ancient tales of almighty warriors
Stay true to your steel and search within
Have faith in the gods believe that you are the one

Come take my hand
And I'll show you the way
Come join our fight
And you'll never walk alone

When we believe, we are but one, we come together
We sail the seas, we're touching ground, we fight whenever
One day will come when all is done, no more endeavors
Until that day, we all stand tall and fight forever

Brothers of Metal - Ride of the Valkyries


I hear the horns are calling, the fight is drawing nigh
Let them bring their thunder, and their puny battle cries
Forging an alliance with my courage and my steel
I am not afraid to die, and I will never kneel

I don't give a FIRE if I win or if I lose
Surviving is a cowards wish, and death is what I choose
My stamina depleted, but I am standing still
When the final blow will fall
I'm ready to be killed

Behold
The sky is burning
Fight
For the sake of death
Brace
For your true ascension
This is the ride of the Valkyries

We are warriors
The bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
And united once again
Mighty warriors
We're the bravest in the lands
Chosen by the maidens
We're the kinsmen of the slain

Are you ready for your destiny?!

Brothers of Metal - Sleipnir

Loki, the greatest magician of all
He's on a mission, a giant to stall
He seduces, disguised as a mare
And carries out Sleipnir, his womb he would tear
He's quicker than quicksand and faster than all
He still has no stable, he lives in a hall
Over the mountains and over the seas
Swifter then time, he moves like a breeze
Faster than lightning he rides
Over the mountain so high
Swiftly he flies over land over sea
All-Father's pony takes the lead
For he is the ultimate breed
And Sleipnir is his name
He carries All-Father from his mighty hall
From battle to battle, he's stronger than all
Like the wind he rides to the north
Eight legs of fire venturing forth
A slippery charger, no one is his match
A god among horses, he strikes and attack
Hooves made of steel, like war drums so loud
Run Sleipnir, run, show us the meaning of haste

He woke up in fear and doubt
Hammerless and mad
"Give it back at once you thief
Or I'll go tell my dad"
Giant slayer, Jotun bane
Mjölnir is its name
It was stolen and defiled
Held as hostage in the giant's games

The adventure of the bride
And how Thor regained his pride

Stealing from a god
You clueless fools
I am the god of thunder
I will show you theft
Your world will fall
And crumble down before my might

Lightning and thunder, follow their path
As they hastily cross the sky
Bridesmaid and bride, ready for death
And the bloodbath that was nigh
"Look there" Loki said, as he pointed to the west
"A castle in the night"
The rage of Thor shone through the night
The thunder in his heart

With vengeance in mind
Hear me, hammer of glory
I am on my way

As our bride waited for his first true kiss
His heart did beat with worry
The hammer must return
His dress fell to his feet
As he felt Mjölnir in his palm - Hammer time
The hammer has returned

Weapon in hand, he sprung from his seat
Crushing the skull of his groom
A massacre of a tremendous scale
Spreading blood across the room
The joy in his heart could not be met
The slaughter was truly obscene
The darkness within the lightning god
And a carnage seldom seen
Stealing from a god
You clueless fools
I am the god of thunder
I will show you theft
Your world will fall
And crumble down before my might

I will never sleep alone (never without you)
Whatever you say to me
I already know
If I said something to you
You would take those words
There's so much power in those words

You don't know
You don't know nothing yet
About the dreams I have
I will make you sleep
You don't know

Amorphis - On the Dark Waters


On the dark waters of Tuonela
Sailed a ship hewn out of bone
Clambering against the current
Swiftly sailing the black waters
No water gushed around its fore
No trail left behind its aft
No oars there were to be seen
No sail hoisted on its mast

Who did sail that boat of bone
Steer the silent ship of death?
As it flew and dove and made its way upstream?
Waiting at the dark headwaters
Were a people sullen, silent
Baying for that ship to take their dead downstream

A ship of bone rose from the river
Called the dead aboard its deck
Through the fiery gates of life
It took its silent passengers
The black waters of that river
Turned to blood, bubbled and boiled
As the boat of bone was blazing
Dead, dry veins ran red with life

Baying for that ship to take their dead downstream

Into a dark bend of the river
Were cast the nameless unborn
On top of a barren outcrop
Naked bodies of the elders
The dead were squinting their eyes
As they once more saw their shadow
They were born to a life of tears
In the light of a forgotten sun

Swiftly on the sable waters
Sailed back the boat of bone
To the dark waters of Tuonela
And the people woke astounded
To the dawn of their new life
(Tuonela's dark water)
Saw the day once more a-breaking
(Tuonela's dark water)
Knew the night would be descending

Amorphis - Brother and Sister


Day is his name
His legs of oaken trunks
His arms of oaken branches
Flames of sun his hair
He stands on the shore
His speech is the wind
The stormy roar of the ocean
His song eternal

When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow cast on the sea
The giant is born again
When the rumbling winds grow quiet
And the roaring waves turn still
A blue shadow on the sea
The giant is born again

Night is her name
Her feet of sarsen stone
Her arms craggy reef
Shoals of fish her hair
She stands on the shore
Stars on her shoulders
The moon floats on the waves
On her blue forehead

A day's light told me of my son's fate
The sun showed the way, grim and severe
Pulled under the raging waters, my child
Sank in the drowning currents, my son
My son

My strength is not enough, my powers failed me
I need the heavens' help, I ask for thunder's force
I plead for you, oh lightning, forge an iron tool
A magic rake for dragging a river for my son

God of fire, bring your light
Forger of sun, help me now
Guardian of the shore will sleep in your warmth
Lull the folk of cold water
Banish the serpents of the dark
To the river let me go and fetch my son away

A rake made of iron from the Gods of skies
The spirit of bright days sent me the sun
Cold troops of Tuoni can not stand in my way
Untouched I shall walk by the river of the night

Amorphis - Dark Path


In the twilight when he steps forth
In the bend of the dark path
When he catches up with you
You won't know if he's on your side
Or if he will turn against you

And in the dead of a moonless night
As your path turns into the black
You become one with the darkness
And in the dead of a moonless night
Who knows if you are brothers
Or will you turn against each other?

And in the dusk when he finds you
Hidden in the shadows
He must judge your allegiance
He won't know if you're on his side
Or if you will turn against him

And in the dead of a moonless night
As your path turns into the black
You become one with the darkness
And in the dead of a moonless night

Dark Tranquillity - What Only You Know


So after all that has been said
Can we find a way back to when
The days were ours to take
And nothing ever hurt
An we failed to offer or forgive

Reach out for the favors
Take down the hopeful light
For even the broken
Even the broken break

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness
That only you know
When the night is long
And the will is weak
Even the broken break

It is a pain you will never know
Held up to a light you once shone
For every hour in my head
The mind distorts
So what can the broken ever say
You might also like
Phase out the noise pollution
Tune out the insanity's dream
Take the hopeless
Take the hopeless down

In the silence only you know
What hides in the emptiness
That only you know

In that darkness
That only you know
Inside the loneliness
That only you know
What hides in the emptiness
What only you know

What if some things are destined to failure?
What if some things are never meant to be?
What if someone never sees?
What if someone never opens?
What if somehow we are different?
Though I never claimed to be right
Give to me, the benefit of doubt!

I brought you fires
All that you put out
I brought you fires!
For I cannot be without
I came with sadness!
But this my shattered heart can't bear!

What of the times in exile?
What of the hours passed?
What if touches seem too trivial?
You can never tell me I'm wrong

Hold your head up high

To a place where it won't matter just what side you're on

Five Finger Death Punch - Coming Down


It's caving in around me
What I thought was solid ground
I tried to look the other way
But I couldn't turn around
It's okay for you to hate me
For all the things I've done
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm not the only one

Step away from the ledge
I'm coming down

I could never be what you want me to
You pull me under to save yourself (Save yourself)
You will never see what's inside of me
I pull you under just to save myself

Was there ever any question
On how much I could take?
You kept feeding me your bullshit
Hoping I would break
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anybody listening?
Will they hear my final prayers?

Does anyone, anyone care at all?

Five Finger Death Punch - Under and Over It


Yeah, go!

Did you hear the one about me being a punk?
Did you hear the one about me being a drunk?
Did you hear the one about me losing my nerve?
Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd?
Did you hear about the money, how it made me change?
So funny to me, all the time that they waste
Did you hear the one about me giving a shit?
'Cause if I ever did, I don't remember it

You can be me and I will be you
You can live just like a star
I'll take my sanity, you take the fame
I'm under it, over it all
I'm under and over it

Did you hear the one about me playing the game?
Selling my soul and changing my name?
Did you hear the one about me being a prick?
Did you know I don't care, and you can suck my—?
Did you hear the one about me trying to die?
Fist in the air and a finger to the sky?
Do I care if you hate me? Do you wanna know the truth?
C'est la vie, adiós, good riddance, fuck you

Up on my family
Up on your social disease

To wash it all away

Five Finger Death Punch - Inside Out


Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it)
I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side
You can love it (You can love it)
Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it)
Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand
While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand
And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained
'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain

There's no denying it, you've never had control

I stand alone
Guess I knew it all along
Yes, I knew that you were wrong
How you left when I was down
I want you to say
It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out
Inside out

I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave)
It doesn't matter how much money I get paid
I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did)
So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin
If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear?
Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear?
If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere?
'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear

One day, the shadows will surround me
Someday, the days will come to end
Some time, I'll have to face the real me
Somehow, I'll have to learn to bend

And now I see clearly

All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I apologize, whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

One day, I'll face the hell inside me
Someday, I'll accept what I have done
Some time, I'll leave the past behind me

Dear Father, forgive me

'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget, would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

Oh, dear brother, just don't hate me

Why I'm always thinking 'bout leaving
It's not like everything's so horrible

And you know all my ins and outs
But everything's way too comfortable

From the moment I wake
I plan my escape

I'm not scared
'Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear, that I'll find it someday
Just wait and see

That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe

Beading up with sweat all over each other
Soaking wet

Found in all the right places
You wanted me to touch
And all those memories
Make it so hard to forget about me

Another chance to gain it just like that
The best you ever had
And do you close your eyes with her
And pretend I'm doing you again
Like only I can
I bet you wish you had me back

It was you and me it seemed to last forever
The way you taste and I still remember
The sounds we made
One day in June I stayed all night
And made love to you like
The fourth of July

Halestorm - Buzz


I do admit, I've come to like the attention
The heavy look in your eyes
So break a piece off of my latest obsession
A taste of pure paradise

I like the buzz because of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?  Is it love?

I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me
Is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz
I like it, I like it

Everybody's keeping their little secrets
Hidden in the bottom drawer
But when it's over there's a terrible fever
That keeps you begging for more

I like the buzz because of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
You might also like
I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me
Is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz

Oh yeah (I like it)
What you're doing to me, baby  (I like it)
Oh yeah, yeah (I like it)
Say, what you're doing to me

'Cause there's a new drug, baby, that I can't resist
It's like a thousand bolts of lightning when we kiss
And can you show me now, how can I get my fix?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

Is it love? Is it love?
Or just the drugs pulsating my veins?
Is it love? Is it love?
Or just a buzz running through my brain?
I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you touching me
Is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz
(I can't sleep)
(I can't breathe)
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz (I can't breathe)
I like it

Ooo, you were really really good last night
Ooo, I could do that twenty some more times
And I, I know better than to play alone then you came along
And I, oh I'm thinking maybe I should call you but no

'Cause now's not the time to be hasty
Oh my God, oh goodness gracious
I'm so damn close I can taste ya

I'm conflicted, contradictive
Got my body confused

Halestorm - Conversation Over


I was in the shadows and you were blocking my light
Didn't know for two years that I was living your lie
You covered all your tracks so perfectly clear
You never talked, told me everything I wanted to hear

I never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time
Just go, this time for sure, we're so no more
Conversation over"

Go, get out, go, go
Get out, go, go

You had it all, had everything then you threw it all away
I tried but couldn't get you higher than the cocaine
I'm sick and tired of trying to save your life
Only you can!

I never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time

Out of my head

I tried to fix you, tried to help you, tried to understand
But we always end up right back here again
I'm out of hope, end of the rope and I'm scared to death how the story ends

I never thought I'd hear myself say:
"Go, get out of my life, outta my bed, you're wasting my time
Just go, this time for sure, we're so no more
Conversation over"

Me and my dirty mind
Been working overtime

Halestorm - Familiar Taste of Poison


Drink the wine, my darling, you said
Take your time, and consume all of it
But the roses were only to drain my inspiration
The promises were spoiled before they left your lips, and

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I tell myself that you're no good for me
I wish you well, but desire never leaves
I could fight this till the end
But maybe I don't want to win

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be sober
I want you on my mind
In my dreams, behind these eyes
And I won't wake up, no, not this time

Some like beautiful, perfect, and pretty
I see the good in the bad and the ugly
I need the volume one louder than ten
Put the pedal to the metal, needle into the red
If the windows ain’t shaking
Making my heart race
If I can’t feel it in my chest
I’m in the wrong damn place

Got a demon in my soul
And a voice in my head
Saying go, go, go
I can sleep when I’m dead
There’s a sonic revelation bringing me to my knees
And there’s a man down below that needs my sympathy
I got a ringing in my ears getting ready to burst
Screaming hallelujah mother fucker take me to church

I like it louder than the boom of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound of guitar grunge
I like to crank it up, make it thump, I'm evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit and throwing my horns
And just like old school Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low and make it heavy
I like it heavy
Who-o-o-oa

Tell me that you love me, oh, let me drive your car
We can sit to morning light, just countin' every star
'Cause if there's a Hell, I'll meet you there
And if there's a Heaven, they're serving beer
And if you're an angel, then I must be high
Oh, if there's a church, it's rock 'n roll
If there's a devil, I sold my soul
And it's alright, whatever we do tonight
'Cause if there's a God, dammit, she won't mind
If there's a God, baby, she won't mind

Halestorm - I Miss the Misery


Oh, I miss the misery

I've been a mess since you stayed
I've been a wreck since you changed
Don't let me get in your way
I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I've tried but I just can't take it
I'd rather fight than just fake it ('Cause I like it rough)
You know that I've had enough
I dare you to call my bluff
Can't take too much of a good thi-ing

I miss the lies and the pain, what you did to me
When you tell me, you'll make it worse
I'd rather fight all night than watch the TV
I hate that feelin' inside
You tell me how hard you'll try
But when we're at our worst
I miss the misery

I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
I miss the rough sex, leaves me a mess
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest

Halestorm - I'm Not an Angel


You made a mistake
On the day that you met me
And lost your way
You saw all the signs
But you let it go
You closed your eyes

I shoulda told you to leave
'Cause I knew all the time you couldn't handle me
But you're hard to resist
When you're on your knees
Begging me

I tear you down
I make you bleed eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you
And it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy
'Cause I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel

Can't help myself
From hurting you
And it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy
'Cause I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel

I wasn't always this way
I used to be the one with the halo
But that disappeared when I had my first taste
And fell from grace, it left me
In this place

Now I'm starting to think
Maybe you like it
I tear you down
I make you bleed eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you
And it's hurting me
I don't have wings
So flying with me won't be easy

Halestorm - Love Bites (So Do I)


One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper and get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways to help you forget about her

That bitch can eat her heart out
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites!

My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' out the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason, I'm nothin' like the rest
I kiss you in a way, you'll never forget about me

It sucks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity by twisting all your thoughts around
They say it’s blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls and won't let go until you fall
I was down and out, got up, and said
“Hey love, I've had enough”
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

Love bites, but so do I

Love bites, but so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I, so do I
Love bites, but so do I, so do I

Love bites!

Two steps I don't rewind
Feeling I can't define
I give back to you

A kiss with these red knives
Why am I driving blind
I give back to you

Try you on for size
I thought boys don't cry
You're my perfect lie

This world that spins around me
Used to make me dizzy
And I'm so tired of these boys that hang around me
Used to drive me crazy

A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone

How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
A little bedlam 'til I'm coming undone

Winds me in a spiral
I'm waiting to unravel
Twisted motives
Lock me in a circle

Halestorm - Nothing to Do with Love


You had your heart set on an angel's kiss
Maybe a taste of bliss
Maybe a long white dress and a fistful of flowers
You wrapped your arms around a murderer
Pretending it didn't hurt
Every time I cut you deeper and deeper
Hey, I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm not the one you wanna give your heart to

You came, you fell
You thought this was something else
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
You beg, you plead
You wanted more than you could keep
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with

Cross my heart, broke your promise, told me lies
Why did you
Watch me suffer, make me feel like I deserved to
Everybody takes, everybody breaks somebody's heart, leaving someone alone
But this felt more like you ripping flesh from bone
You made a mess out of me
Where do I begin?
You'll pay for your sins

Like a reckoning
You never saw it coming
I'm the reaper outside your door
You took everything made me feel less than nothing
I'm getting what I came for
Like the sound of falling stars crashing in the dark
I said a prayer and buried your name
And up through the ashes I rose like wildfire

The reckoning

I gave you more than my heart could hope for
You misused it
Scraped up every piece that fell to the floor
When you tore through it
Laying me to ruin
You knew what you were doing
Leaving me to skin and bone
But trusting you was no one's fault but my own
You get what you give
So take your last breath
'fore I lay you to rest

Baby what have we become?
A billion empty skulls
Dumb and out for blood
Forgot about the love
Just another empty

Look now
A billion zombies marching one by one

I can't close my eyes
And make you fade
I won't shut my mouth
God, no, I won't be another empty skull
No, I won't give you something beautiful (There it goes)

Skulls, a billion empty skulls
Filling their empty lungs
With the wrong kind of drugs
Baby what have we become?
A billion empty skulls
Dumb and out for blood
Forgot about the love
Just another empty

Halestorm - What Sober Couldn't Say


Headed for a black out, hurting like hell
Finding my way to the bottom of the bottle
Packing up my suitcase, leaving no trace
One step closer with every swallow
Deafening silence, that you liked me
When you want me, saying nothing
Not this time, I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say

What sober couldn't say
Couldn't break through
Under the influence of you
Incoherent, truth serum
Just enough to make me bulletproof
I'm so over this love gone violent
I'm drunk and brave enough to say
What sober couldn't say

Criminal in my mind, I've been doing time
Believing in the lie that you still loved me
Making up for the slammin' of the door
Always wanting more but never giving
Sick of cryin', tired of tryin'
Always buying into every kiss
Not this time, I'm gonna say

I know what you must be thinking
You're not right
You should know I'm not your baby
Not tonight (I never was)

You see it from the outside
You're running toward the wall
Swinging from your blind side
But you don't know me at all
I've been here too many times before
And your tears don't mean a thing
I only come when you scream, I told you

Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence

Is this what you wanted
Did I make your dreams come true?
You're sitting in a corner
Wondering what you got into
And you ache for things you don't understand
That your tears don't mean a thing
And I only come when you scream, I told you

Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence

I've seen the rest of you
But I know there's something more in your room
I'm right outside your door
Show me things you've never shown before

A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
All you have to do is let me in your room

You can be yourself
You don't have to hide from me, I won't tell
I know everyone you've ever trusted has let you down
And you don't want to come out

Open up so I can see

A few pictures from your past
And those walls you painted black
And the secrets that you keep under your bed
An unopened letter from your dad
A poster of your favorite band
It don't matter I'll take every part of you
All you have to do is let me in your room
Let me in your room

I'm back from the dead!

Out of the black
Breaking free of the wasteland
Out of the mud
Crawling up through the quicksand
Leaving the dark, coming into the light
Don't lay me down, save your last rites

'Cause I'm still standing above ground

Back from the dead alive!
Hell couldn't hold me
Back from the other side!
Up from the dirt I rise
Save your prayers, don't bless my bones
Erase my name from my headstone
Back from the dead alive!
Hell couldn't hold me down!

On the edge of the world getting lost in oblivion
To the devils who tried to keep me living like a prisoner
Couldn't chain me down, couldn't cage me in
So keep your savior, give me back my sins

Halestorm - Strange Girl


Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you scared?
Do I make you wanna just stop and stare?
Weird, bizarre, unusual
Sicker than sick, atypical
A perfect picture of your fucking worst nightmare

Do I make you frightened?
Do I make you fear for your life?
When you're so certain I'll infect you when I'm near
Obscene, twisted, unnatural
Off the wall, unacceptable
I'm bulletproof to what you think

So you can damn me straight to hell
You can crucify my name
You can throw me to the wolves
You can burn me in the flame
And say
She's such a strange girl
Such a strange girl
The world needs strange girls
Just like me
You might also like
Cast me out, abandon me
Write me off for dead
Ridiculed, made to feel like I'm your deepest dread
You say
She's such a strange girl
Such a strange girl
The world needs strange girls
Just like me

Would you call me daughter?
Would you love me when
My halo's bent and crooked when you call me malcontent?
Sad, sicker than usual
Can't you be more like the girl next door
Instead of little miss misfit

So you can damn me straight to hell
You can crucify my name
You can throw me to the wolves
You can burn me in the flame
And say
She's such a strange girl

Such a strange girl
The world needs strange girls
Just like me

Do you hate me
Just to change me
To be just like you
To be just like you
Do you fear me
To make me feel empty
So I'm just like you
I will never be like you
I'll never be you

So you can damn me straight to hell
You can crucify my name
You can throw me to the wolves
You can burn me in the flame

This is my castle
And these are my people

This is my anchor
It's been a long road outta Hell up to the steeple
For this is my church and these are my people

A choir's singing in my heart today (Whoa)
Like a thousand angels breaking the silent parade
To the ones I call my own
I'm back whеre I belong

Scrapes on my hands, blood on my knees
Pick myself up by my own beliefs
I carry my sins, no need to confess
Won't scream out for mercy
When it puts me through hell

I set it on fire, I lay it to rest
Here's to the hurt, so I wouldn't forget
My heart can survive it, I'm stronger than this
They ain't built a weapon that could kill me yet

Don't need saving to save myself
Don't need forgiveness to bless my guilt
Lost my faith and found belief
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption

Took back my life through an ocean of tears
In a hole down so deep, suffocating from fear
Running from purpose while losing my grip
Building thе walls that built me brick by brick

So here's to thе dagger, the sword, and the pain
If not for the dirt, the shovel, the grave
A shock to my system that opened my eyes
And made me believe
You might also like
Don't need saving to save myself
Don't need forgiveness to bless my guilt
Lost my faith and found belief
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption

Don't need praying to find my hope
Don't need Heaven to save my soul
Fell from grace just to believe
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption
I'm my own redemption
I'm my own redemption

Set it on fire, I lay it to rest
My heart can survive it, I'm stronger than this
They ain't built a weapon that could kill me yet

In my redemption, I'm my own redemption
My redemption, I'm my own redemption
My redemption, I'm my own redemption, yeah
My redemption, I'm my own redemption

Don't need saving to save myself
Don't need forgiveness to bless my guilt
Lost my faith and found belief
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption
And found belief
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption
Now I believe
In my redemption, I'm my own redemption
I'm my own redemption
I'm my own redemption

Kamelot - Anthem

What's a miracle, if life itself is not?
Who am I to praise it's worth
With a hymn?
I may stumble over words that I forgot
Just as life itself will slowly begin
Sing me a song for the mountains to move
Sing me the anthem of life
Sing me the anthem of life
I'm skeptical, I like my glass of wine
I don't know your name, or what I am to do
One day you'll wonder why, try to read between the lines
And you will sing for me, the way I sang for you
Sing me a song for the ocean to part
Sing me the anthem of life
Sing me the anthem of life
Sing me the anthem of life
So another page is turned
Pray I understand what's happening
But if anything, I do know this
I'll be the best I can
Sing me a song like the angels rejoice
Sing me an anthem of life
Sing me the anthem
Sing me the anthem of lifeYou might also like

Kamelot - Center of the Universe


Move slowly
Beyond the colors of my eyes
Move slowly
Into the corners of my mind
Rising like the pegasus
Each and every one of us released
Islands in the sea of dreams
Always searching harmony and peace

All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why

If the war by Heaven's gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
'Cause in the center of the Universe
We are all alone

Show me sign of paradise
A place we all would like to go to
Tell me what to sacrifice

Follow me into the core of the fountain of light
Try to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul
(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)
Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all
(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)

Kamelot - Forever

There's a pain within
That I can't define
There's an empty space
Where your love used to shine
From the night we met
Till the day you died
Do you think I wished
Do you still believe I tried
All too soon we were divided
And life had just begun
Will you revive from the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever
I belong to you
You belong to me
It's the way things are
Always meant to be
Like the morning star
And the rising sun
You convey my life
And forgive me what I've done
You might also likeAll too soon we were divided
Into darkness and light

Reverse how I'm thinking of you
Every breath I take
Brings me closer
Closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone
All too soon we were divided
And life had just begun
Will you revive from the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever

Kamelot - Under Grey Skies


In the ruins of madness
A ghost of a chance
There is new hope reborn in every tragedy
And the world I see bares
A mystery waiting to be revealed

And don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you, in you

In the age of confusion
Tears and despair
Let me sell you a dream of prosperity
In this great illusion
Our humble intentions are well concealed

Cause don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

When I drown in my fears
In the darkness of sorrow
There’s a promise of grace
Under silver grey skies
And I’m drying my tears
In the blaze of the sunlight
A reverie sealed with a kiss
And...

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you, in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me

Lordi - I Dug a Hole in the Yard for You


Here's the story of you and me
Summer sparks and we knew it was meant to be
Something changed in your heart with the turning leaves
November cold when you tried to go
Blaming me, I'm a monster that you don't know
New Year's Eve and I gave you a ring of gold

For better or for worse (You promised, promised)
The worse is gonna hurt (Know it, know it)
Lay you down under the dirt
My love is strong and it will find a way
You're saying stop but I don't got all day

I dug a hole in the yard for you
So you won't break my heart
I dug a hole in the yard for you
Just to know where you are
I dug a hole in the yard for you

Soon it was March we were like a dream
And then in May spring bouquets for still loving me
Come July and it's our anniversary
Your family is annoying me
I tell them all that I feel like you're dead to me
Our love shall remain in secrecy

My love is strong and it will find a way
You're saying stop but I don't got all day

I dug a hole in the yard for you
So you won't break my heart
I dug a hole in the yard for you
Just to know where you are
I dug a hole in the yard for you

It was All Hallows Eve
The stink of earth assaulted me
I turned to see your sunken eyes stare back at me
And I screamed

I dug a hole in the yard for you
So you won't break my heart
I dug a hole in the yard for you

Can you hear?
Are you ready?

Clouds are taking deadly form
Black becomes the sky
Locusts start to swarm
Skeletons are brought to life
The branches of the cherry trees
Impaling their prey
Pestilence and war
Rain destruction down today

Grandpa’s footsteps in the snow
Are clear and then disappear
Mother in slow motion
Kills her dear infant out of fear
Hear ye, hear ye
Oh, there’s no denying what’s coming here

In the air a frightful thing
Part animal, part machine
Swooping down on bat-like wings
To shred using razor teeth
Death from above mercilessly
Annihilate everything

And I'm scared to be around you, I'll get hurt

I hope you're still in there somewhere
I tell myself that I still care

And it's not your voice
Your tongue's got the cat

'Cause I guess I fucked up, messed this luck up

Take a shot and let it roll

Let me tell you something

I was born as a bastard, no father, no master
A shadow in silence left searching for answers
Put up for adoption and left with no option
Another kid fostered to fester, forgotten
Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they’re cast into the wretched hive
But I ain’t going down alone

Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?

Ashamed of the racists they used to call brothers
'Cause no flag can mean bravery
When bloodied by slavery
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior
And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares
So will I stand here all alone?

I have roared at the world for years
(Is there anybody out there?)
Doesn’t anybody hear me?

This burden suffered, I’ve paid the cost

Not all who wander are lost

Swallow not the shit they feed

Machine Head - Darkness Within


Here in this darkness that I lay
Depression heavy in its way
And how my body aches to leave
And sing its final eulogy
My sons I love you evermore
And though the road beckons once more
I see the damage that I've done
And search for redemption
But I am just a broken man
Whose soul cries out to understand
How the madness shatters me
Upon the stage on bended knee
I scream aloud at skies above
That answer mute, bereft in love
I struggle not to fall from grace
I sing the hymns of my disgrace

We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within

Mystery's forgotten chords
I strum in vain to please the lord
But he has never answered me
And faith has waned eternally
In empty men who pass along
The woes of all religions wrong
And now the shadowed veil it falls
Heed the clarion call
You might also likeSo pray to music, build a shrine
Worship in these desperate times
Fill your heart with every note
Cherish it and cast afloat
'Cause God is in these clef and tone
Salvation is found alone
Haunted by its melody
Music, it will set you free
(Let it set you free)

We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within

This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder

Skillet - The Resistance


(I) am a nation, (I) am a million faces
Formed together, made for elevation
(I) am a soldier, (I) won't surrender
Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
(Who's gonna stand up, who's gonna fight?)
The voice of the unheard
(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
You might also like
(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up

Skillet - Rise


All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made
Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

Rise

Rise, rise

Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy, crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up, no
If you wanna keep what you love!
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

We're never afraid of
Writing new lines on this tale
Where we will dive, still it's unknown
But in the end
Everything will be given by faith

Your ideology can't stop the wheel of time
Not even our dreams
We will follow the signs

Nothing will ever be the same

Why am I fighting another night
With something I can't believe is real?
I am restless and broken
Why?
I need you to tell me why
The skeletons in my closet
They're endlessly twisting my feelings
I'm hiding from the darkest side of me

My demons can't sleep, they're wide awake
And this is not the perfect day
My demons can't sleep and I can feel
That there's no rest or peace for me

That's impossible

They won't fade away

How did I end up in here?

Turning and turning the story won't change
Hiding my faults just drives me insane
Running and running away from myself
It isn't exactly the way out of hell

What if I finally say
Let it go!

Temperance - Litany of the Northern Lights

Once there was a peculiar man
Who was destined to be a lonely wanderer
Northern son, a boat-builder he was:
Strong and deep his desire to change the world
Can one man ride the waves and the winds
Just for pleasing the gods and their majesty?
To hit the road to redeem your own sins
Would have meant joining them for eternity
Not my time, I'm not ready to die!
Is this really the end of the story?
Northern lights will appear in the sky
May my spirit be embraced by the glory
Loud the roar of the ocean below
Overlaying the sound of a solemn prayer
Sent the raven towards the unknown
Of the chance of a failure he was aware
Oh brave man, you will find a new land
Born of fire and ice as it's meant to be
Feel the breeze and caress the black sand
You'll discover the truth that will set you free!
Come this far, I am not going back
Am I alive? Give me a sign!

Northern lights will appear in the sky

Read inside of your soul and your mind
You will know what to do, how to feel

Temperance - Broken Promises


I'll find the courage
To fight the demons here inside
The time has come but
I'm not feeling strong enough
To beg for mercy
Let me put all that aside
Avoiding all my doubts
And the consequences of my life
Everyday I try to explain
How my mind is bound in chains
There's no way
What a shame

But if I say, if I say "leave me alone"
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray, I will pray for your return!
(And) what if I, say if "I say I won't let you go
Let you go anymore!" I'll know how
Broken promises hurt deep down inside

Promise me now
Let's find a way to heal my scars
We'll look up above
Reaching for the stars
You might also likeWhat I feel what I like

(And) what if I say, if I say "I won't let you go
Let you go anymore!" I'll know how
Broken promises hurt deep down inside

I'll write about what it means "to feel reborn"
Don't waste your life apologising every time
There's more to discover, take some advice
Pack all your bags and know the world outside!

But if I say, if I say "leave me alone"
I will spend all my days staring at the phone
I will pray, I will pray for your return
(And) what if I say, if I say "I won't let you go
Let you go anymore!" I'll know how
Broken promises hurt deep down inside

The saviours turned the tide!
Demigods they were: they talked
About another world, upside down
Ready to embrace all humans! "Let's go together!"

Three Days Grace - Fallen Angel


Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

Three Days Grace - The Good Life


The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

All I want is a little of the good life
All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh
The good life

All I need is to have a good time
Oh, oh, oh

Three Days Grace - Someone Who Cares


Every street in this city
Is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be
But there's no room for me
Am I to blame?
When the guilt and the shame
Hang over me
Like a dark cloud
That chases you down
In the pouring rain

It's so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find someone who looks down on you
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone who looks down on you?

When you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me
That nobody sees
So nobody cares

Hello, mountain, remember me?
Child of your womb
I return from a perilous place, to the warmth of your hollow
Embrace me
Steady giant, monolith
Lend me your heart
I am weakened again, tired
Mend my scars
As your power, it sinks into me
Your roots take their hold
My body as one with the earth, my blood as the stone
The mountain, my home

Heavy walls enclose me. cover me in endless warmth
And now the dreams will come
Lucid freedom takes me
To a world no longer run by the laws of relativity
Fly out beyond the stars, where the wind takes me
Away, and leads me through the dark, defying gravity

Can you follow me? Follow me to apex

To look up into the night's sky
To see the stars, they are changed
To know a thousand years or more have passed, and I am the same
This mountain hollow that keeps me in a suffocating embrace
A prison and a safe haven, it's always been this way

Lo, a new master calls me to awakening
I know this one brings the end
Far out beyond the darkness I've been living in
It's true, a whole new world awaits

Stellar constellations rise
Lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized
To roam, to never die

My path begins with the new dawn
A voice is calling my name
It always starts as whispering then manifests to a scream
I'm drawn to the creature that wakes me
Bound to them by the curse
My soul exists only to serve, a covenant of birth

Despite the promise made to me to let my soul be free
Revealing upon my return intentions to betray
Yet all the same the fact remains I knew it was a lie
In all these years I’ve learned to hope is no way to survive
The ritual completed now she has what she demands
And I’m just another pawn for her to do as she commands

Now I return to the mountain keep
Slumber again for eternity
Call me Immortal
The world no longer my concern I wander home in peace
No sense at all in lingering, my chamber calls to me
If ever I was done with life; this last one caused me pain
And here I thought I had control of everything
The future hovers on the edge in the hands of one insane
My power is the tipping point and now she knows my name

Here you are, you’ve finally come

Listen well, this is why you are here
I need you to find my sons
Journey wide, they’re spread across the land
They will hide, they know what I plan
My sons were born for one purpose only
Their blood my elixir of life
Return them alive, I’ll kill them myself
I’ll open their throats and drink from their skulls
The ritual is very precise
Bring them to me before the planets align
The altars wait in silence, an effigy
Soon their purpose divined
Blood will run as rivers upon them

Cleanse the bloodlines
Free me from the clutch of Death incarnate

End all the cowardice now!

Amaranthe - Do or Die


Oversee, insanity
Misfortune and apathy
Have to stop, don't live life in denial
Time to end humanity
Apocalypse, our remedy
Reap what you sow, death and fire!

Break free, it is time to believe
In the struggle we see, we're the enemy
Retreat, from the battle inside
We can win if we just do or die!

What happened to the seasons? Fallout in the sky
We can only change if wе do or die
So justify your reasons, look me in thе eye
Right now we just do, we just do or die
Do or die!

What you wish, is what you see
A victim of vanity
Manufacture your own reality
Destruction our legacy
Delusion is haunting me
Still we claim supremacy
You might also like
Retreat from the battle inside
No serenity, we're the enemy
Break free from the genocide
We must change or we will die!

What happened to the seasons? Fallout in the sky
We can only change if we do or die
So justify your reasons, look me in the eye
Right now we just do, we just do or die
Die, die, die, die
We just do or die
Die, die, die, die

Controlling us
To consume without
Any hesitance for the residents
Of this fading earth


What happened to the seasons? Fallout in the sky
We can only change if we do or die
So justify your reasons, look me in the eye
Right now we just do, we just do or die
Do or die!

Amaranthe - Helix


I can't stop you from breathing
Give it all and then see you leave it
I will stand and defeat it
Undertow stuck in the middle

Lift the veil of the darkness
Be the voice of the broken hearted
Just like you I unleashed it all
To reverse my heartbeat!

All the voices in my mind
And the times that we denied
As I will reach into the light
We cannot get out of

Make a start with the helix (helix)
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see that
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the phoenix
Until the end of time
So forgive us
For sinning
Make a start with the helix
You might also like
Nothing you say, how much you pay
Never making me stop
And every time you complained
You were bringing me up
And now you come around begging
Now I'm at the top
You'd better pray I never break
Because you are draining my cup

Found my way through your Eden
I can see the soul-seeking pathway
Scream for help if you need me
I'm prepared to receive the heathens

All the voices in my mind
And the times that we denied
We have come to the end of the line
We cannot get out of

Make a start with the helix
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see that
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the phoenix
Until the end of time
So forgive us
For sinning
Make a start with the helix

Close your eyes, and open your mind

How much I paid just to get to the top
And how I built from the bottom up
And now I know I had to come back
This is a vision of the future not a flashback

Make a start with the helix
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see that
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the phoenix
Until the end of time

With the speed of light I'm letting no tomorrow stop me
Like a razorblade cutting through your veins
I consume all the life within you
I transcend the madness I'm beyond all premonition
Suddenly I, I ascend to the skies
Without wings you fall from grace

A million stars I pass, I speed towards the heavens
To let me feel divine again

Out of the dark, into the sun
I'm in a higher state of mind
A brand new start
I will transform into the fearless (The fearless)
A stronger force above the ground
The radiant era has begun
Out of the dark, into the sun
Because now I'm fearless (Because now I'm fearless)

Like a force of nature rise to ultimate dominion
Like a race against all the times you said
"You transformed to something different"
I transcend the blackness that consumed me, I'm beyond it
Suddenly I, I ascend to denial
Without horns, I fall from grace

My precious faith got lost and found
Still thinking of you
It is engraved in fallen vines
Still linger with you

I didn't break, I didn't change
I didn't close my heart
Will we ever see, will we ever learn
What is real and what is true?

I can hear you
You are afar
But I know my heart is crystalline
Don't fall down now
This is a start
And I know your heart is crystalline

I cannot wait, been long enough
Still burning for you
When will I be forever locked
Inside of your heart

("There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.")

We spin the world like a pinball machine
We have thoughts of a life in abundance
Day and night we wish movies were real
And what's behind the screen is our entrance

I'm like a satellite, transmitting different eras
I am the voice of the next generation
Completely digital, create synthetic auras
Start a revolution now

You will never have to cry, cause the future is sold
You can never die and you'll never grow old
Oh, but everything surrounding you is digital
Never break the mold, you do as you're told
Freedom is for sale if you give them control
(Oh) Erase, return in a digital world

I know it feels like you're part of a dream
You can fly and fight wars without judgement
You respawn and mistakes will repeal
But you will always be searching for an answer

Right now, I wanna be the enemy
I hide, empower our remedy
Step up, get your game on
Get your pride back
Never back down, oh
And as I open my eyes
I see my shadow
Will I return like my self or parted atoms?

I have the will inside my mind (Inside my mind)
There is a voice I can't deny

I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within

Yeah, I rise so you can be a part of me
I hide as part of the machinery
I've stepped on the wires
Feeding the flames to burn higher
And as the darkness reveals
I see no reason
For me to reach for the cure
I'm my own demon

Just let it out of me
Break it out of the core
To help me breath

Amaranthe - Act of Desperation


A bitter revelation is a product of ambition
No matter what you say, I'm a stranger to submission

But what I see before me is an element of passion
In my recognition is the fallout of compassion

Taken life for granted, never struggle just to find
Illusions being planted deep inside of my mind

It's an invitation to the corner of my mind
Act of desperation to see what I can find (To see what I can find!)
Here's our destination, so come on, step inside
Take my hand and you will discover what I hide

Deciphering enigmas is a part of who you are
Identify the secrets of the eagle and the compass star

So let it be proclaimed that I'm a slave to revelation
Show me your compassion, be a part of our creation

My time couldn't see it coming
But I lost my senses it was falling away
Couldn't leave in the middle of the night
Took the dawn to the day and the day to the night
Every single day that I've done my time
Raising every doubt that is in my mind
My crime I rhyme
And everybody's set aside I take it take it down
And you know that you can't face me
Got to face that you cannot help me
I can feel every day that I'm lost in a dream
I've been searching my dreams for a lifetime
I don't want to believe it's the last time
The way that I feel
Like I want to be free in serenity

And I am sincere
Won't give in to my fears
I don't want to be
Lost in a dream

But I know it's a chance we can redo what's already done
I can fix you I wanna make you strong
But somehow I've known you long
I have no doubt a needle in the eye
I want to change and I know what's right
Cross the waters
Crossing the line
Cross the borders

And I know that you won't fear me

Amaranthe - Exhale

Elize
You sense there's a purpose of a higher life
A force in your heart as if you were revived
Brand new grounds to explore before the night arrives
Jake
With unlimited options, it has just begun
I've done things that you won't, I wish I'd never done
As I look through the eyes of what is my design
You've taken the ascendancy
Elize/Jake
Shaking me, saving me in the darkest hour
Fear was a part of me, growing stronger
Breaking into my soul, let me see eternity
Henrik
A life is a dream, one way directional
It starts with a cell to something magical
You've been handed the world, a new identity
Elize: Compelling me, you're my relief
Elize/Jake
Shaking me, saving me in the darkest hour
Fear was a part of me, growing stronger
Breaking into my soul, let me see eternity
Turning me, burning me in the darkest hour
Fear was part of me, growing stronger
Breaking into my soul, bringing me serenity

Amaranthe - Faster

We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
Faster
Depleted every source, endangered our own lives
A soil that is burned, destruction unrepairable
War of the worlds; orchestral demise
So what comes up always falls straight back down
Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We set ourselves on fire for our last goodbye
We're going faster like a bullet 'round
To save the future for the humankind
We're giving our hearts away, we're going faster
Defeated every threat and made this habitat burn
This cynical form, mankind made sure we never turn
Mission is set; we colonize afar
An epiphany for us all as there is no withdraw
Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies

Amaranthe - Fireball

How can I justify before it fades
When all I want is more, more, more, yeah?
Like a wrecking ball each step I take
'Cause every time you're screaming my name
I can't take it any longer
Cross your fingers, say a prayer
There's no way out, I'm leaving you there
Face this mess, your days are numbered
Will I live to survive?
I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball
Holding my breath, I'm about to explode
Counting down again like three, two, one, boom
Would you be satisfied to stand out in the rain
With no sympathy, like dogs fetch a hand grenade
I can't take it any longer
One step back, review the past
A lesson learned where bridges still burn
Face this mess now you're outnumbered
But I'm making you rise
You might also likeI will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball

Breakdown, ten to one, my hunting ground
Our chemistry blend all in all
This fight is mine, I never bow
Countdown, ten to one, my playground
You will never ever get me but
I'll break you down (Fireball)
I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball
I will make it rain
Like a waterfall I am your fireball
I will light the sky
I will make you whole like a fireball

Amaranthe - Inferno


Lighted up, spotted out
All the barriers denied
Trade it in, fade the spot
Tracked it down to the hidden believers
At the start nobody saw you didn't care at all
Can't get it out of me

All the senses are numb
On the spot paralyzed
I got 99 problems but your hate ain't one
All the traitors, invaders with bitter accusations
They wait for my fate
You can try but you can't break me down

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying
See the inferno rise!
I am not scared of the things you do
When you go down I go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny - inferno
We cannot get everything we need
The Inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me it's all that I need - inferno
You might also like
All the hate and the lies
And the problems that you find
And the fights you make up
Make you feel just a little bit better
Don't need to see at all
Pride before the fall
Strength inside of me!

If the curtain goes down
And I reach the divide
I got 99 reasons why I won't back down
I won't fake it to make it
No force will ever shake it
I wait for my fate
For what goes around comes around

You never thought I would sit in silence (in silence)
But you commend me for even trying
See the inferno rise!
I am not scared of the things you do
When you go down I go down with you
We can go crazy inside and then we deny - inferno
We cannot get everything we need
The Inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me it's all that I need - inferno

Begin to climb, I see the pinnacle
I can suddenly feel that I was in denial
As I transform into the mythical
From the ashes I see the inferno rise!

I never said I can sit in silence (in silence)
You cannot blame me for never trying
See the Inferno rise!
I am not scared of the things you do (I am not scared)
When you go down, I go down with you (I go down with you)
We can go crazy inside and then we deny - inferno (inferno)
We cannot get everything we need
The Inferno is what we feed
When you give it to me it's all that I need - inferno

Foreseen, half man, machine I am

As flames arise, I boil, I shake
A destiny of how it's made
It tears in me, I need to let it be

Jake: See me bleed I'm one the run, ooh-oh

Drives us to accept no more
Become what we were before

Repent, repeat the history
I'm half the man I used to be

Enhanced with powers never to be seen
I falter in a darkened dream
A winding path that's haunting me
It's black or white, it's my eternal life

We all die. The goal isn't to live forever
The goal is to create something that will...

I keep on hearing them saying what I should do
I, I've come to see it through to the end of the line

And the end of my commission
Is the actual condiction of my life
I begin my transformation
To the only definition of what's right

So leave the world behind
I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign
From the past, it took me higher than life

Amaranthe - That Song


It was a hard time living in the city
Broke my mind always tryin' hard to fit in
Somehow I tried to belong
They were always telling me that I was wrong
I was runnin' around I was chasing a dream
Behind the lights on a dirty limousine
I had it inside I was comin' along
Then it changed when he sang me that song

Oh, oh, sing me that song
I miss that sound sound bringing me home
Oh, oh, same old song
I left my soul soul living rock 'n' roll
Oh, oh, sing me that song
I miss that sound sound bringing me home
Oh, oh, same old song
I left my soul soul living rock 'n' roll

It was a rough time running out of money
Had a guitar 'round my jacket on my shoulder
Somehow I tried to be strong
But everyone just told me that I tried for too long
When you come to the road where you have to decide
I tell you how to fight it and it will be alright
I got chains deep inside
Now I can't live without it
And, yes, you are right they are playing my song

I step on solemn ground
But it is not enough, no
'Cause not yet satisfied
Till I see that flash in your eyes
Reversed indifference

And you can not deny
What I have sacrificed
An unsuspecting side of you
A blackened paradise
Feel the corruption rise
A billion souls adrift but life can save us

Come and you'll find
The temptation of human desire
Rise high
Come find life

I tried with all my might
Crossed to the other side
Suspended disbelief, oh
A resurrection of
Of the principles of what's right
A jester's theory

And so I have denied
Disrupted paradise

The temptation of human desire
Rise high
Come find life


Life can save us

Rise high

Come, intertwine

Amaranthe - Damnation Flame


Voices of the Matriarch
A hierarchy outside of the status quo
Tormented legions feast
Upon the innocent, entrench the control
The choice of condemnation
Breeds an army of accursed
The dominion will grow
Codified in the circle
So let it be known
She will be enthroned

Watch her ascend
Concede unto her
And now you relent
For she has crossed the oceans of time
Damnation you'll find

Damnation Flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of The One in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what She wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation Flame

Ruled across the centuries
The heresy our mark on the fevered soul

Premonition untold
Was your immortal soul
Now you shall behold

Lifeblood is spent
Surrender to her
Now you repent
Her bloodline is damnation divine
Damnation you'll find

Damnation Flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of The One in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what She wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation Flame

Entwine the pain
You're stigmatised
Temerity from dusk to sunrise
Embrace the flame
In dusk reside
Mortality a frailty denied

Watch her ascend
Concede unto her
And now you relent
Her bloodline is damnation divine

Damnation Flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of The One in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what She wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation Flame

Arch Enemy - The World Is Yours


Rise into the light, set flame to the night
Sick of being told how to run your life
Their rules
Their schools
Empty words that promise so much
Their precious status quo remains untouched

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

Every empire was raised by the slave
Built through the ages, you can destroy it in a day
Turn the page
Unleash your rage
Burn their golden cage and walk away
On your path toward ultimate power

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours
You might also like
Straining at the leash
Foaming at the mouth
No more subservience
Justice will be done
There was only so much
You could take
There was only so much
You could tolerate
When the bough breaks
The empire will fall
 (whispered)
If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

If you want the world
Use your mind
Take control
Feel the strength
Rise from within
If you really want it, the world is yours

Arch Enemy - First Day in Hell


Torn from home, sent down death's railroad, are we
When we wake up tomorrow
Will we still be wearing this curse?
Will we wake up tomorrow?
Which punishment is worse?
Day one: no sun
Stripped of our names
Now we are merely numbers
Permanently inked in the flames

Our kind, our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

Innocent men, women, children
Sentenced before conviction
With golden stars to guide them
Their gavel is the end of a gun
Day two: lived through
More culprits arrive
Every cage so crowded
How will we survive through the night?

Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine
First day in hell
Incarcerated without reason
Doomed by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation
Our birthright

Week five: alive
Soon out of time
After all that I've, here, witnessed
There's no value in life

Our kind, our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked
First day in hell
First week in hell
See the terror in abandoned gazes
Fear-sunken eyes
Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine
First month in hell
Incarcerated without reason
Doomed by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation

Arch Enemy - Handshake With Hell


Collective consciousness
Synapses between us
We pierce the sky with fists
We shroud the Earth in dust

Bow, sit down, take a knee
Before powers that be
We're here to spread the flame
Welcome to the game

And after all is said and done
Since the moon eclipsed the sun
Can you feel the wrath of truth?
Does it burn you like abuse?

Come along to the killing grounds
It's execution day
Thе grip of a thousand hands
Squeezes the life from suprеmacy

And after all is said and done
When the dark delays the dawn
Walk your path towards the reaper
Learn that hell is other people

We rule the world beneath

And after all is said and done
Before a new day has begun
Bid your worries all goodbye
Flee the pan into the fire

Obey
As we
Decay
Buy me a lobotomy
Fools never cease to amaze
Keep digging your grave
A lobotomy
Fool me once and I'm numb
Twice and I'm dumb
Thrice, I won't be fooled again
Fool me once and I'm done
Twice, I succumb
To a handshake with hell
In the end, we only reap what we have sown
Can't leave well enough alone
The world's at stake
Under an oath that cannot break


Obey
As we
Decay
Buy me a lobotomy
Fools never cease to complain
Keep digging your grave
A lobotomy

Arch Enemy - The Watcher


Born to a flock of animosity
To be judged, to be shamed, no rights and no dignity
Beneath the eye of disdain
Where The Watcher sees the wicked, we compel

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the Eye…

Don’t fear The Watcher - sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Bеware The Watcher - thе Earth is erased in Flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last

Does the gaze activate quantum complicity?

Arch Enemy - As the Pages Burn


As the pages burn, secrets can't be unlearned
Silence can't be unheard
Knowledge is burden, power is upon us
As the pages burn
Your memories fade
Freed from the grip of reality
Rejecting cognition
As the pages burn
Sinking in a pool of ether
The past is washed clean

Rip apart the world
Word by word
Inch by inch
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn (Burn)
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn

The future is in your pen
Ink to paper, now begin

Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience

Arch Enemy - Sunset Over the Empire


Welcome to the apocalypse, the end of days
Rulers of the wasteland, rejoice in the flames
Futures tumble, legacies crumble
Thousands of years and what have we learned?

They heard the warnings, ignored the signs
Wheels of injustice kept on turning
Unaccountable for their crimes
On the streets anger burning

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war
“It’s the end of an era, a new dawn will rise”

Words turned to war, brother fighting brother
Another false truce, as the people die
The fate of the nation forever changed
Behold - the fiery end is nigh
Behind closed doors, corruption wins
The power echelon prepares their task
One step forward, two stabs in the back
Revolution is a mere change of masks?

Is there a future to be found?
Hopes and dreams…now ashes on the ground

What's left to say that hasn't been already said before?
Did I ever have a purpose? I can't feel it anymore
If ignorance is happiness, please, steal me from my head
'Cause the voices once so soothing make me feel so fucking, so fucking dead

I'd give anything for something to feel anything at all
It just seems so goddamn meaningless, it all seems so devolved

Bullet for My Valentine - Letting You Go


I don't understand just why you wanna keep me guessing
What I've done or what I've said to make, make you feel this way
I get the feeling this is never getting any better

Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go

In a vicious circle
Can you tell me why?

Reach in and pull them out!
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate

And live again!
Why can't I run and escape from myself?

Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out

Oh my god is this really the end?

Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out

There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be!
Why can't I run and escape from myself
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end

Bullet for My Valentine - Pretty on the Outside


Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

So you want to play games with my head?
But you make me fall apart, I wish that I was dead
I just can't believe I fell, for such a blackened heart
You played me for a fool and used me from the start
Fuck you! (fuck you!), I just want to know the truth
But the words from your mouth they just cloud
All the negativity, forces me down into (silence)
But still I can dream
I want to know
I want to know

If I tear you open wide, take a look inside
Are you pretty?
Can I get inside your mind, see what I can find?
Are you pretty?
So just take off that disguise, everyone knows that you're only
Pretty on the outside

Now I fucking hate you, with all of my heart
So just disappear, and never will I fear for my life
I just want to be alone
And never, no never, will I be unhappy alone
I want to know
I want to know

Bullet for My Valentine - Rainbow Veins


Body shakes
I got rainbows running through my veins
And now
I just can't come down

Flying high
I'm still drowning in the chemicals
And now
I just can't come down
Diving headfirst into a black hole
Becoming unstable mentally
I'm trying hard to ride these tidal waves
Of unfiltered ecstasy

Another day, but I don't wanna face it
(Oh-oh-woah, oh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna heal so I'm self-medicating
And I don't wanna feel it now
Another day, but I don't wanna face it
(Oh-oh-woah, oh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Another dose just to keep me sedated
And let reality float away

Bullet for My Valentine - Shatter


It's gonna break me, but that doesn't matter
Another crack, watch me shatter
Oh

In a world where I don't belong
Like a stranger I'm moving on
To a place where I wanted to be
And call it home
Wanna feel like I did before
Feel the love, feel the pain and more
But the weight keeps burying me
And I feel so cold

Opening wounds, breaking the bones
Giving a life for selling a soul
It's gonna break me, but that doesn't matter
Another crack, watch me shatter

I don't exist, I was never alive
But now I know I'm ready to die

In a world where I don't belong
Like a wanderer, a vagabond
Will my feet keep carrying me
And bring me home?
Will I breathe like I did before?
Feel the hate, but with no remorse
But the cracks still seem to appear
And I can't control

Bullet for My Valentine - This Means War


Trust, well, that counts for nothing
But hate, well, I guess that's something
Cause when it all breaks down
You'll be running your mouth
My patience coming undone
I can't keep biting my tongue

Scream your lungs out
And keep on wasting your breath
I've heard these warnings before
(I guess that this means war)
What's the fallout
Now let the battle commence
I've heard these warnings before
(I guess that this means war)

It can't be easy to swallow
I keep forcing it down
And you keep throwing it up
Your life now empty and hollow
You keep on twisting the knifе
And I keep ripping it out

And drown, in your empty ocеan

Scream your lungs out
You know you'll write up your death
I just don't care anymore

On every word that you said
I gave this warning before

Eluveitie - Alesia

The grass was as green as it always was that sinister day
The blackbird sang their songs as they always did that black-letter day
The day we passed the great gate for the very last time
I did not look back, I knew we'd stay
I knew they would not let us go leave the death strip
I saw the gleam in their eyes of fear and enslavement
The crushing weight
Beloved ground take me home
Alesia, Alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Lanotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice
On that ground we cherished life
And embraced death
As the children's cries trailed off
Sob yielded deathly hush
Alesia, Alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Lanotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

We offered a living sacrifice
Outside the doors of Alesia
Where our tears run dry

Sprinkled by the trappings
Of words that make the outlines
Blur on the showplace of made history
The folk is willed
To parrot the dishes up tale
The lure of a higher meaning
Cheat to had to create
An enemy stereotype
To receive your absolution
A frothy poor excuse for your foray
To disengage from deeps
Of your encumbrance

Behold
All our gold
Thousandfold
Bereave me
Declined
Truths ensign
Forever mine
Bereave me
March in with ten legions
Whilst the crucial weapons not the pilum
But the feather held in your hand
Penned in blood
Your tall-tales rule the forum
Altering it into the battlefield

Eluveitie - Calling the Rain


A nexus fruition, whirling cognition
Ulterior, the failing of words
A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home
Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light

Vastness engulfing the soul
Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness
The grain has to die, perish to bestow new life
A vis major painting a rapturous view
Heralding a vivid thema

Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like bearing in pain
Like embracing life and decaying in death
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma
I will not forget what I arose from

The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy

Eluveitie - Tegernakô

A folk of cheeriness and strength
Content with the life they lived
So-called barbarians yet with eyes cleared
For what they truly need and what damn not
Free and plain
Barbarians, farmers and savages
Counted as ignorant and uncivil
But told to bow before the emperors throne
They were at least not venal
True and plain freedom - of this natures clan
True and plain pride - of this Celtic clan
True and plain dignity - Tegernako!
Not for riches, not for sway
Not for economic benefits
Met they the emperors requirements
For freedom can't be boughtYou might also like

I wonder what it's like to attack at night
And mow down the defenceless
Invasions and raids just called
Fucking, punitive Expeditions
Like a wildfire
Devastation spreads
Across all Gallia
From Helvetia to Eburonia
The Ravener's insatiate
Havoc
Think of yesterday
Ruin
A mass illusion! How could it come this far?
Narbonensis was not enough
The Empire needed more
From Aremorica to Carnutia
Plagued and war-ridden Land
Wars inflicted on free Gallia
An organised downfall
A black cloud of Imperial
Rapacity unleashed

Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands

The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free
Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain

For those who'll never lower their blade
We're blood brothers till the end
The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall
Let me hear your battle cry!

Gib niemals auf
Gib niemals auf

Nach der Ebbe kommt die Flut
Und wilder Sturm entfacht die Glut
Wer die Angst erkannt, hat wahren Mut
Und reitet in den Sieg
C'est la vie

Denn wer nicht kämpft, hat schon verloren
Nur wer fällt, steht wieder auf
C'est la vie (Wo-oh-oh)
So nimmt das Leben seinen Lauf
Darum haben wir geschworen
Unser Feuer brennt nie aus

Wir sind für Keilereien konditioniert

Einst ein edler Kaufmann auf ein Mädel traf
Direkt vor den Toren von Dummdidadeldei
Er fragte sie, woher sie stammt, ein Weib so hold und brav
Und wie es sie hierher verschlug, nach Dummdidadeldei
Sie antwortete ihm sogleich mit engelsgleicher Stimm'
„Ich komme doch sehr wohl von hier aus Dummdidadeldei
Doch darf ich fragen, wer da spricht, gehüllt in edlen Zwirn?“
Dеr Kaufmann küsste ihr die Hand: „Man nennt mich Didеldei“

Und sie gingen in die Taverne
Und sie tranken edlen Met
Und sie träumten von der Ferne
Und sie sangen dieses Lied

„Wusstest du denn gar nicht, dass ich Dummdidudel heiß’?“
Den eselsgleichen Kaufmann, oh, den liebestollen Tor
Übermannt in seinem Rausch der Drang nach Dummdidadeldei
Doch ist der Papst katholisch und sie war'n ein Liebespaar
Die Nächte waren lang und Dideldummdidudeldei
Das klingt heute vielleicht komisch, doch schon nach nur ein paar Jahr'n
In Dummdidudeldei hatten sie 13 Kinderlein

Rise and reign
Far from the Fjords and the ice cold currents
Ravens soar over new frontiers
Songs and sagas of a fate determined
Shields and spears
Vows of favour or the thrill of plunder
Pull together for the clan and kin
Clank of hammers and the crash of thunder
Pound within

Gdy będę duży to chcę mieć u stóp cały świat
Wierni w pokłonach, niewierni z podziwem zza krat

Już jestem duży, lecz nikt nie chce mnie słuchać, nie
Nie za bogaty, marzenia na raty, jest źle
Co zarobiłem to zaraz przepiłem i wiem
Że błąd popełniłem, lecz za cholerę nie wiem...

Będę szczery, zamierzam zostać bestią
Może Bogiem, kto wie
Tuż za rogiem królestwo czeka mnie

Znowu wracasz w Nasze strony
Mimo ronionych 
Czeka tutaj Cię kaplica
Hej, rycerzu chędożony!
Ty nie słuchasz, obrażony
Nie podoba się kaplica
Wypierdalaj, taki zwyczaj
Jest trochę ciężko bo świat tu nie rozumie mnie
Ciężko pracuję, zabijam, nie czuję się źle
Jak nie zabijam to żołd swój przepijam i śnię
Chłopcy w koszarach szanują jednak...

Będę szczery, jestem nieludzką bestią
Może Bogiem, kto wie
Z większym wrogiem toporem radzę se
Dwie siekiery to moje jest królestwo
Jestem szczery, jestem nieludzką bestią
Może diabłem, kto wie
Już za rogiem królestwo czeka mnie

Bugi to żartowniś, niepodzielnie trzęsie całym lasem
Nie ma tu takiego rysia, by potrząsnął tym dryblasem
Urwie ząb i wetknie ślimakowi dla swojej radości
Łamiąc go doszczętnie, chociaż biedak nie posiada kości

Zawsze pierwszy, nigdy drugi
Król kawału, figlarz

Bugi to dowcipniś, chociaż niektórzy twierdzą inaczej
Wszyscy jednak zgodnie drżą w obliczu natury łajdaczej
Będzie prał, aż nauczy humoru w BoroSpołeczności
Ostro grał, bo ponuraków nienawidzi od małości

Zawsze pierwszy, nigdy drugi
Król kawału, figlarz Bugi
Zawsze pierwszy, nigdy drugi
Sfrustrowany figlarz Bugi

Zawsze pierwszy, nigdy drugi
Król kawału, figlarz

Hunter (POL) - Kiedy Umieram

Kiedy rodzisz się nawet góry toną we krwi
Będąc dzieckiem pragnień nadzieją zabarwiasz złe sny
Bredząc trzy po trzy powiedziałeś, że Ty
Jesteś Władcą Snów - uwierzyli bez słów
Krok po kroku ich opętałeś
Kat oszalał brodząc we krwi
Tak twój lud bezmyślnie pogrążał swój kraj
Wierząc ślepo w Ciebie szedł dalej próbując
Odnaleźć swój Raj
Bredząc trzy po trzy przypomniałeś, że Ty
Jesteś Władcą Snów - wierzyli bez słów
Poszli w ogień za tobą - zginęli przed!
Powiększając armię cieni
Umieram - gdy widzę jak błądzimy we mgle
Umieram - gdy czuję, że trwamy we śnie
Umieram - bo wiem, że Ty nie rozumiesz, że ja
Umieram - gdy widzę jak Ty
Chciałeś dać swego Boga innym, choć tego nie chcieli
Żyli w zgodzie, spokoju - swojego Boga już mieli
Bredząc trzy po trzy oznajmiłeś, że Ty
Dasz im Władcę Snów
Nie pojęli twych słów
Więc zginęły miliony - ich słowa brzmiały dziwnie
Ten sam Bóg nosił inne imię!
You might also likeUmieram - gdy widzę jak błądzimy we mgle

Umieram - bo wiem, że Ty nie rozumiesz, że ja
Umieram - gdy widzę jak wciąż
Fanatyzm jest przekleństwem narodów
Kult jednostki, religijny, polityczny, nacjonalizm
Będą zawsze tym samym - czarną stroną człowieczeństwa
Nic nie tłumaczy morderstwa!
Umieram - gdy widzę jak błądzimy we mgle
Umieram - gdy czuję, że trwamy we śnie
Umieram - bo wiem, że Ty nie rozumiesz, że ja
Umieram - gdy widzę jak Ty
Kiedy umierasz - spokój gasi ich łzy
Lecz z odejściem twoim wkrótce nadchodzą złe sny
Koniec prawie zawsze jest początkiem
Bredząc trzy po trzy wtedy zjawiasz się ty
Jesteś Władcą Snów - zawsze idą bez słów!
I znów zginą miliony gdy wraz z dziećmi swymi
Zmienisz inny kraj w krainę cieni
Umieram - gdy widzę jak błądzimy we mgle
Umieram - gdy czuję, że trwamy we śnie
Umieram - bo wiem, że Ty nie rozumiesz, że ja
Umieram - wciąż widząc to

Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words
As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore
The image I project is me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed
After the education you stopped making sense to me
Seems to me that it's all the same
Time and time and time and time again
Slowly, what I believed in, turning into a lie
To aim and miss, my supernatural art
Spending too much time with myself
Trying to explain who I am

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay
I need someone to break the silence
Before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
Before I break you in parts
You might also like
So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art

I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay

In Flames - I, the Mask


From here, I can hardly see a thing
We're further off with every passing second
I will follow anyone that brings me to you
But the sense of time is catching up with me

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?
If I act like I'm untouchable and golden?

Wonder when I'll hit the ground
Been to space, but I am falling
Wasting what is mine
For a voice that's calling

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

I am done with watching graves grow mould
The sins are mine, I believe them to be
You might also like
All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, I'm on my knees
Feel like you've forgotten me

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

How could you leave me behind?
I'm tired, and I felt it for some time
I can't take this much longer
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral


All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, give me a sign
Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am, in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?

In Flames - Call My Name


You don't remember so I need to figure it out
But the memories fade
The truth is that I'm not so sure if we make it at all
I can't even trust myself

I used to have it all
Until I lost control
I used to have it all
Until I lost control

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls, through the halls of time
A sign for me to go by
So find me the wormhole so that I can be by your side

Sometimes I'm angry, and some days I'm totally numb
I just wanna give it all up

Why don't you call my name?
Let it bounce between the walls, through the halls of time
A sign for me to go by

In Flames - Dead End


Save all your prayers
I think we're lost today
There's no morning after
No one's around to blame

I'm not afraid to bleed
But I won't do it for you
A star among hypocrites
The melody of our time

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the Earth

Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
Here's the next disaster

What decides when you've lost the war?
When the first man falls?
Or when they erased it all?
You might also like
We're too numb to feel
The downfall starts right here
Hold your breath and swim
Swallowed by life's tear

In times of make believe
No one really seems to care
Maybe I should care less
'Cause I will die too

So say goodbye to the world
We are the dead that walk the Earth

Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster

What will it take for us to realize?
The more we provoke
Winter will come twice

Save all your prayers
I think we're lost today
There's no morning after
No one's around to blame

Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster
Scream your lungs out, wait for laughter
You don't have to wait forever
It's the next disaster

In Flames - Pinball Map


As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum with my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time
I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange
You might also likeNever been able to use the force

Despite all the misguided faith
I'll find a place in this mess

Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I shrivel up and waste away
Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map

In Flames - In the Dark


It seems so real when you whisper
Just like holding down your breath
We're slowly dying
So how do we solve this without regrets?

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

We have to fight through the shadows
I feel we've lost the spark
Ignite the dampened spirits
And build a brand new arc

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voicеs in the dark

In Flames - A Dialogue in B Flat Minor


All you see is me breathing fire

Can you see the madness or do I hide it all too well?
Ask the right question, you will have a show and tell
I see spiders crawling up the wall
It's only a matter of time
I lose all sense of control (All sense of control)

All the clowns they look the same
Afraid I'm gonna suffocate
Have I gone insane?
Am I the devil's bait?

Give me the strength to fly away
Don't recognize this place, I think I derailed

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I can't see how things will change
(I can't see how things will change)
Will those feelings ever fade?


All you see is me breathing fire
Have I gone insane?

Tanssista tuvan perälle

Portit pohjolan näkyvi
Paistavi pahat veräjät
Kannet kirjo kiimottavat
Yössäni valo tulesta
Tulesta yö ylle pääni
Päästä saarelle sukuni
Suvun alta hauen alle

Siellä on kolme koivupuuta
Neljä valkoista keloa
Yhden alta taivon kannen
Kahden alta aamun laulun
Siellä on kolme koivupuuta
Neljä valkoista keloa
Kolmannen koko sukuni
Kultamielen sulkaseni

Eikä hukka huolta juokse
Hallava perältä maitten
Katsoo silmin seisovaisin
Näöllä sinisen taivon
Maita maiden vaskilinnun
Teitä kultaisen käkeni
Puut jo päältä pääni käyvän
Kaaren peura-hännälleni
Valkoturpa Turvanani
Jänkäkoira silmänäni
Kotina kovan eloni
Hukkasielun syntymäni

Kun mä kerran lähdin kiertämään
Sen mä muistan aina varmaan
Katsoin merta, loputonta
Kädessäni mary verta

Grappaa sain italian poijjalta
Oluset saatu saksalaiselta
Kitkerät katkerot vuolahasti tipahtaa
Kun krapuloita vapinoita kavahtaa

Hei! Hei! Hei!
Olen viinamäen mies
Koko ranta raikaa ja kainalot on hies
Hei! Hei! Hei!
Ja hieskoivun taikaa
Kun kuumassa vihtoo joka ainoo mies

En tänään huolia aio
Ikävöidä menneisiin
Aion elää joka hetken

Jalat kantaa vaan
Roihuaa korpi tän klaanin
Haudan takaakin kajahtaa

We can't withstand forever - The flame will set us free
As long as we're together - We dance in the ashen rain
Stand side by side no matter - How long the road may be
And when we're burned, forever - We'll dance in the ashen rain
We missed the moment when our life came asunder, baby open your eyes
Inside the error, witness of the final blunder, under a black sky
And still you sing with the rain so low
Will we know when it's time for us to perish? Mankind burns in the flames
All those people that you knew, despised or cherished
They're all dead or insane but we blaze our trail
We can't withstand forever - The flame will set us free
As long as we're together - We dance in the ashen rain
Stand side by side no matter - How long the road may be
And when we're burned, forever - We'll dance in the ashen rain
Like cinders of the ashen rain
Glowing, smoldering, we're floating, in circles hovering
We're dancing - The dance without a name
Embrace it when you can't change the game
I just want us to come home
Come home

We are the face of silence
We raise our voices without a sound
We are the face of silence
Bury our future deep in the ground
Gallantry and sympathy - Pretending what they'd like to be
Annihilate those who still think and steer our world straight to the brink
Follow the pied pipers tune - Your noble garb and silver spoon
The tribune built for you to cheer - It all will burn and disappear

They knew about the risk before they started to compile
Their source-code became self-aware, a rogue intelligence
They tried to pull the plug, cause they could not delete the file
So arrogant and unprepared, it conquered their defense

This is our last historic day
In a nanosecond it assumed control
The extermination of mankind is underway
Perfect logic of a binary soul
Endgame

Hail to the mind of man

On this day we die
It is the mind of man
Fire in the sky

It played us off against each other, no way to make amends

Orden Ogan - The Lake


At midnight by the fireplace
I fell in love with her portrait;
Her eyes revealed
She knew I'd take the bait
It's said she rests for many years
Moonlight will make her appear
In the lake that she had filled with her own tears
I gathered all of the stories we have been told
I never questioned she was really out there...
Obsessed by the secret that she may hold
I will find her anywhere...

And there she lies, with open eyes...

In the light of the midnight sky
I have found one good reason to die
Take me down to the quiet place
In the lake where she sleeps in grace!

It's said she rests for many years
I can see her shade appear
In the lake that she had filled with strays and peers

Oh, how the cold fills me out
As the starlight blurs over me;
Going deeper
Emerging into the black
For the first time, I feel free

And there she lies, with open eyes

In the light of the midnight sky
I have found one good reason to die
Take me down to the quiet place
In the lake where she sleeps in grace!

Orden Ogan - The Things We Believe In

It was our own fault that we couldn't stand our ground
The eternal winter is near
A million lives just wiped away without a sound
Leaving a dead world in fear
No need to run, we're just waiting for someone
No eyes to see what we have become
We should die for the things we believe in
But live our  lives  in the dark,  self-deceiving
In the snow, all the world that we knew is ice
And so we are: cold, dead, and gone
Shine a light til the dark sky is burning
Wolves are howling and fortune is turning
But our hearts and the words that we say are ice
And so we are: cold, dead, and gone
Betrayed by greed and pride we stumbled through the dark
Confusing blind men with kings
How can we ignite the flame while missing the true spark
Or have we reached the end of things?
No need to run, we're just waiting for someone
No eyes to see what we have become
We should die for the things we believe in
But live our  lives  in the dark, self-deceiving
In the snow, all the world that we knew is ice
And so we are: cold, dead, and gone
Shine a light til the dark sky is burning
Wolves are howling and fortune is turning
But our hearts and the words that we say are ice

Orden Ogan - We Are Pirates!

A black sky above, our kingdom beneath
Die in the waves or live on your knees
Three trials before you leave the shore:
Mastering the sword
Learn the art of thievery
And find treasures galore
Get a ship and a crew of three
And search the foreign lands
And when the wind of hell embraces thee
You'll gain the idol of many hands
A black sky above, our kingdom beneath
Die in the waves or live on your knees
Come, raise the flag of the fallen
We reign the storm and the seas
And live our lives on the brink of death
We're pirates! And we are free
Prove your courage and touch the gruesome winged devil
Trust the navigator's head
For all the rum and grog don't forget to revel
For tomorrow you could be dead
You might also likeAnd beware of falling in love at all
Or your heart will beat inside a chest
I guess you figured it out - what I recall 's
Another story from another quest

Come, raise the flag of the fallen
We reign the storm and the seas
And live our lives on the brink of death
We're pirates! And we are free
Come, raise the flag of the fallen

Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay

Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving

Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going, blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting, swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening, you know death is near

No remorse

Metallica - Creeping Death


Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed, to his every word
Live in fear
Faith, of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four-hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire

By my hand (Die, die)
I creep across the land (Die, die)
Killing first-born man (Die, die, die)

I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lamb's blood-painted door
I shall pass
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son

Nightwish - 7 Days to the Wolves

The wolves, my love, will come
Taking us home where dust once was a man
Is there life before a death?
Do we long too much and never let in?

Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
This is my church of choice
Love's strength stranded in love's sacrifice
For the rest I have to say to you
I will dream like the God
And suffer like all the dead children

Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us

Where heroes
And cowards
Part ways
Light the fire, feast
Chase the ghost, give in
Take the road less travelled by
Leave the city of fools
Turn every poet loose

7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?

Nightwish - Alpenglow


Once upon a time a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse

Together we slay another fright
Every jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see

We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow

Hand in hand, guiding me into light
You, the fairytale guise in blue and white

Together we slay another fright

Nightwish - The Crow, the Owl, and the Dove


Don’t give me love, don’t give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don’t give me love, I've had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead

A crow flew to me, kept its distance
Such a proud creation
I saw its soul, envied its pride
But needed nothing it had
An owl came to me, old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned its ways, envied its sense
But needed nothing it had

Don’t give me love, don’t give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Don’t give me love, I've had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead

A dove came to me, had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched its calm, envied its love
But needed nothing it had

Nightwish - Dark Chest of Wonders


Once I had a dream
And this is it

(Once there was a child's dream)
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
(Once there was a child's heart)
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside

(Once I knew all the tales)
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
(Once I wished for this night)
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

Nightwish - Dead to the World


All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poets world
Gave comfort to the fallen
(Heartfelt, Lovelorn)
Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, Ocean soul)

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)
I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Dead, silent, constant
Yet always changing

As he died, he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth
Giving birth to the Century child
Who gave his life not for the world, but for me
Innocence reborn once more

Nightwish - Endless Forms Most Beautiful


Come on, hop on, let's take a ride
Come and meet the travelers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars

We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, a resthaven
Of life

Lay on a field of green
With Mother Eve
With Father Pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous

Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful

To see the Tiktaalik take her first walk

Greet the one we'll soon become

It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a Birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow
Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me

And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Nightwish - Higher Than Hope

Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother, the pain ain't hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near
The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you
Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Passiontide
An angel by my side
But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has shown me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I'll be gone
The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you
You might also likeRed Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies

I just would like to think that, not why it happened to me
But why was I saved?
What else could I do now?
Your death saved me

Being in the dark about something, I can't even tell you how scary it is
You don't know what's inside, you don't know what's gonna happen to you
And the best way to put somebody at ease is to inform him
Even if it's the grim truth
Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies

Nightwish - The Islander

An old man by a seashore at the end of day
Gazes the horizon with sea winds in his face
Tempest-tossed island, seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted and a ship without a name
Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
Showing the way, lighting hope in their hearts
The ones on their travels homeward from afar

This is for long-forgotten light at the end of the world
Horizon crying the tears he left behind long ago
The albatross is flying, making him daydream
The time before he became one of the world's unseen
Princess in the tower, children in the fields
Life gave him it all, an island of the universe
Now his love's a memory, a ghost in the fog
He sets the sails one last time saying farewell to the world
Anchor to the water, seabed far below
Grass still in his feet and a smile beneath his brow

This is for long-forgotten light at the end of the world
Horizon crying the tears he left behind long ago

Nightwish - Over the Hills and Far Away


They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
"You stand accused of robbery" - he heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains, and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms he swears she'll be
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Nightwish - Sahara


A ballad of a dark queen echoes through night
As he flees the curse of gods, the pharaoh's wrath

1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen

Ancient mariner in a sea of sand
The burning beauty his tomb to die for

1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
(Horizon's swarming with death)
(Run!)

Heaven has a darkened face
Dunes are soaring, as on a chase
Caravan of the cursed
Chasing him across the waves
May he now rest under aegis of mirage
As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields?

Nightwish - She Is My Sin

Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch
Nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb
Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's a perfect one
To paradise with pleasure, haunted
Haunted by fear
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

Nightwish - Turn Loose the Mermaids


A kite above a graveyard grey
At the end of the line far far away
A child holding on to the magic of birth and awe

Oh, how beautiful it used to be
Just you and me far beyond the sea
The waters, scarce in motion
Quivering still

At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveler rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes

Good journey, love, time to go
I checked your teeth and warmed your toes
In the horizon I see them coming for you

The mermaid's grace, the forever call
Beauty in spyglass on an old man's porch
The mermaids you turn loose brought back your tears
You might also like
At the end of the river the sundown beams
All the relics of a life long lived
Here, weary traveler rest your wand
Sleep the journey from your eyes

Nightwish - Weak Fantasy


These stories given to us all
Are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust
Dissonant choirs and downcast eyes
Selfhood of a condescending ape
Behold the crown of a heavenly spy
Forged in blood of those who defy
Kiss the ring, praise and sing
He loves you dwelling in fear and sin

Fear is a choice you embrace

Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale

Pick your author from à la carte fantasy
Filled with suffering and slavery
You live only for the days to come
Shoveling trash of the upper caste
You might also likeSmiling mouth in a rotting head
Sucking dry the teat of the scared
A storytelling breed we are
A starving crew with show-off toys

Fear is a choice you embrace

Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale

From words into war of the worlds
This one we forsake with scorn
From lies, the strength of our love
Mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn

Wake up child, I have a story to tell
Once upon a time
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale

Nightwish - Whoever Brings the Night


We seduce the dark with pain and rapture
Like two ships that pass in the night
You and I, a whore and a bashful sailor
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind

All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night

The dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night
Eyes so bright, seductive lies
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part
Poisoned dart of desire

All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night

Choose a bride tonight, a fantasy for a zombie
Hurt me, I love to suffer, your harem's a dream for free
(Enter, suck from us and live forever
Rotten beauty will haunt you for a lifetime)
Come with me underwater, and drown to despise me no more
Unholy, unworthy, my night is a dream for free

Nightwish - Wish I Had an Angel


I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel tonight

Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me, fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before

Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

Drunken disguise changes all the rules

Last dance, first kiss
Your touch, my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

You're born to cast aside, see the final time is near

Mores, we override, for we are the undead seed

Say will you stand up for Christ and combat
Ride
Defend the Kingdom of God
Alive in the conquest of Normans
Crossed the land, to Byzantine shores
We storm Constantinople's walls
Gone ahead, the army went on
Arrived at the river of Jordan
Brave the dread, Jerusalem's sons
And one by one the pilgrims fall
And by the city of Sidon
Their bodies lying to rot
And underneath blood and iron
Lies the promise and honour of God
Say will you stand up for Christ and combat
Will you fight like a rebel, a rebel in black
Say will you stand up for Christ and combat
Will you sanctify the dark?
Kill and pray, crusaders at heart
In 1097 we started
Lost the way and spread all apart
The Holy Roman Empire
The remaining knights, prepared for attack
To honour the Prophet departed
On they fought, with no turning back
The kingdom rides forever more

Prone to the grave, the dark side you walk
In the light of the morning we fall
Confront the brave, the rebel we stalk
When we came - When we saw - We conquered them all
Blessed when we die, confessed not a lie
In the still of the night we awake
Don't dare to cry, when fever up high
No escape - No break - Your life we will take

Gone with the night
When the unholy demons of dawn
Pray
When the sunlight is dead we're reborn

We are dead until dark - When the night is calling
Dead until dark - And at midnight high
Dead until dark - And at dawn we all will die
We are dead until dark - When the saints are crawling
Dead until dark - And the demons fly
Dead until dark - We unite the bloodred sky

Cursed by our fate, the undead crusade
For the sanctum deep under your skin
Raise up the blade, by night we invade
For the last - Of times - The fight may begin
Murder bizarre, nocturnal we are

Sent from the dead, we long for the red

Powerwolf - The Evil That Men Do


Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, yeah
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Come praise The Lord in flame

Powerwolf - Higher Than Heaven

In the night we break the sorrow
In the night we come alive
In the night adrenaline is higher than heaven
In the night with no tomorrow
In the night that demons rise
In the night when carnal lust is higher than heaven
The cross on your wall, the demons inside
Come raise my sword to heaven
The night to befall the pulse of the tide
The bell did strike eleven
And when the night has come
No, we never will return
Where the mortal pray (for) resurrection
When the light has gone
In the sacristy we turn up high... and wake

Hu-hah-hah
Hu-hah-hah

Follow the dead in the dark of damnation
Pious in head and a demon at heart
Sworn to the night, an evangelist nation born
Under the sign of the dark
Gather the wild from the horde of the brave men
Brothers allied, fight the storm of this curse
Banners up high as we rise like a legion sworn
All for the light we inverse

Combat ahead and the night calls for heroes
Ready for fire command
Revel in red come and wake up to bring no remorse
Stand up as force

Rise over the dead, bring us ahead, incense and iron
Fight all of the night, banners up high to the top of the land
Right into the red, all you can get, incense and iron
Stand, follow the fight, doing the right as we come to defend

Cannot deny all the wonders are sacred burst
Under the weight of this world

Remedy sent and the sky falls in treason
Torn by the liar's intent, devil in head
Come and break out and raise up the sword
Stand up as horde

Rise over the dead, bring us ahead, incense and iron
Fight all of the night, banners up high to the top of the land
Right into the red, all you can get, incense and iron
Stand, follow the fight, doing the right as we come to defend

A murder in the dark
The convent in the night
The constable is on the way
The suspect out of sight
He trampled down the garden lane
The mystery has begun
He signed by the pentagram
And now is on the run
Ha, ha, ha

I gotta tell you a story
And the story we start right at the scene of the crime
Another murder and tonight he's left in time
Another victim had gone
Another inhuman slaughter on the lane of a park
And still the chief inspector tumbling in the dark

At night I saw him
Can you recall him?
And not a soul has called

Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight
And then we tell you to pray
You might also like
He must have done it alone
He is a master of hiding, and he left not a trace
And by the moonlight saw the goat shape of his face
He got an interrogation and they tried hard to break him but it couldn't be prooved
For the only trace they could find was cloven hooved

At night I saw him
The phantom crawling
And not a soul has called

Murder at midnight
The enemy on the way
Murder at midnight
Will he return with the day?
Murder at midnight
The Devil's seed on the way
Murder at midnight

And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now

Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe

Fingernails start scratching
On the outside walls
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me", it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Powerwolf - Nightside of Siberia


Find a trail of war and darkness
In the night when they made us all believe
On the way to fate and Gloria
And we never found retreat
Curse the demons in the fortress
When to fight and to force them on their knees
For the lord we pay euphoria
Lead a life, too late to flee

Fire before the enemies can see
Fire before the morning
Fire without a warning you will bleed
Tonight we still our need

Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far
Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far

First we take them into moonlight
Then we light up a pyre in the maze
And aboard the flight to eschaton
May the father lead our way
Born to suffer life, immortal
Caught and damned for a light we'll never see
Led astray beyond euphoria
And betrayed as all who pray

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal 'til the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause they want to fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag, no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

Powerwolf - Panic in the Pentagram

The night dies in the morning
And hell is gone at dawn
He sent no bible warning
Forsaken and forlorn
The night was wild
Black magic has its price
Remember me?
You'll meet the devil twice!
In the morning when I wake
No more souls are left to take
And I wonder why I'm here
The Sun is up, it's almost nine
And I'm standing in a sign
I feel a slowly rising fear
In a circle did I sleep?
Had I blasphemies to keep?
The scent of sulphur in the air
Hail, hail pentagram
Hail, hail pentagram
God damnit
What have I done?

Powerwolf - We are the Wild

At the end of our time we stand
Hold the cross by the iron hand
Holy Christ in your command
We call on the dark
Be the last of the human kind
With no blood in you heart and mind
Alone into fire we walk
If we come all before you wake
Pray the lord your soul to take
For your blood will build a lake
Sing Halleluja
In the night when you rest your head
And we rise up from the dead
Unholy and fallen we are
Wild, wild, we are the wild
Wild, wild, pray god and cry
Wild, wild, few are the wild
And till the morning
Stand up and fight
We are the wild
And after midnight we're alive
Can't stop the wild (stop the wild)
Forever born to hail the night
You might also likeIn the dark of the night we pray
For the dawn of the final day
For unlight to guide the way
And god take our hand
Overhead where the demons die
And the daylight blinds the eye
Alone on the pyre we stand
In the daytime seek to hide
Till at sundown we unite
To begin the sacrifice
Scream Halleluja
Ride the storm and raise your fist
Celebrate the eucharist
Go out in the night for we are
Wild, wild, we are the wild
Wild, wild, pray god and cry
Wild, wild, few are the wild
And till the morning
Stand up and fight
We are the wild
And after midnight we're alive
Can't stop the wild
Forever born to hail the night
We are the wild
Until the morning we survive (we are the)
Can't stop the wild
For we are born to win the fight
(we are the)
(we are the)
We are the wild

We fought the daylight
Any battle, any war
The call for blood worth dying for

We prayed for twilight
Side by side we stood as pack
But still tonight you won't come back

The night is over
But in the morning don't lie dead
Remember all the blood we had

And we'll meet where the wild wolves have gone
All we bleed in the Armageddon storm
And we'll meet where the wild wolves have gone
All we need is the sacrament

We begged for mercy
Any hour, any day
To bring back nightfall we would pray
You might also like
You left us bleeding
In a silver bullet rain
Still in this world you can't remain

When dusk is calling out for blame
And on this empty grave your name

All we bleed in the Armageddon storm
And we'll meet where the wild wolves have gone

Deum 

Beast of Gévaudan
Feared no sword and feared no gun
Sent from Heaven, the seventh of creatures
Beast of Gévaudan
For the wrath of God to come
Came to sanction the mass and the preachers

Hunted by hundreds and never to be caught
He's sent to wander, bring terror and take 'em all beyond

To the Father and the Son
Came the beast of Gévaudan
Terminator, a traitor, half wolf and half machine
To thе prior and the nun
Came the bеast of Gévaudan
A redeemer, believer all fatal, mad and mean
Beast of Gévaudan

Beast of Gévaudan
Christ's forces on the run
Meant to feast on the treason of liars

In the night no man can run
From the beast of Gévaudan
No escape from the fate of a martyr born in pain
When all prayers said and done
Tame the land of Gévaudan
And the curse of the beast will remain

Powerwolf - Blood for Blood (Faoladh)


Stand up from the dead in victorious sight
We strike with the ire of God
Come stand up for war, no surrender at night
All riders are drowned in their blood
And evangelists gone in the flood

To the end, to defend
To the glorious night
To the praise of the cross and the dead

Fight us, spite us
We have the might and the glory
Bite us, light us
Strike with the force of a God
Swear us, tear us
We are the fall of the holy
All the night, it's blood for blood

Altars to defend and Christ in command
We die for the Lord and the cross
Onward to the end, we all wander this land
No combat we fear and no loss
No surrender no battle is lost
You might also like
To the end, to repent
To the glorious times
To the praise of the fallen and damned

Fight us, spite us
We have the might and the glory
Bite us, light us
Strike with the force of a God
Swear us, tear us
We are the fall of the holy
All the night, it's blood for blood

Fallen to descent, we died in command
No prayer, no crest, and no throne
Sunken and banned, no rest, no repent
The bravest of hearts turned to stone

Faster, wider
We come alive under fire
Darker, wilder
Stricken by fever at heart
Sacred riders
Born into flame on the pyre
Hear the call, it's blood for blood

Powerwolf - Undress to Confess


In sainted moments of dark
Unveil yourself by request
For any sin you confide
We take a cloth off your breast

And all the night
We are blessed in Heaven high
Told we're best before we die
From the Lord she will get her kicks
Dressed to hide the dark
And obsessed to ride him hard
On the crucifix

She came to undress and confess (confess)
Together undress and confess (confess)
All the night in a mess
For the lust in the heat of excess
We all undress to confess

Reveal yourself to the pastor
Brings forgiveness the best
For any fabric on skin
Corrupts your mind like the pest

And for the night
She was dressed in heels up high
For the mass is alibi
And the altar, it gives her kicks
Naked skies
See her go down at night
When on the cross she licks

Together undress and confess (confess)
All the night in a mess

Find a trail of war and darkness
In the night when they made us all believe
On the way to fate and Gloria
And we never found retreat
Curse the demons in the fortress
When to fight and to force them on their knees
For the lord we pay euphoria
Lead a life, too late to flee

Fire before the enemies can see
Fire before the morning
Fire without a warning you will bleed
Tonight we still our need

Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far
Nightside of Siberia, Siberia
And the morning's far

First we take them into moonlight
Then we light up a pyre in the maze
And aboard the flight to eschaton
May the father lead our way
Born to suffer life, immortal
Caught and damned for a light we'll never see
Led astray beyond euphoria
And betrayed as all who pray

So sprach sie ihren Liebsten an
Ob er es ihr steigen kann

Sie will es und so ist es fein
So war es und so wird es immer sein
Sie will es und so ist es Brauch
Was sie will, bekommt sie auch

Tiefe Brunnen muss man graben
Wenn man klares Wasser will

Are You Ready to Rock?
Now's the time
To rearrange your life
Live for something
Outside of your own mind
We all dream
The same dream everynight
To burn the world that you call civilized
Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
I'll never understand
The who, what, why or when
Of you tonight...
We face the stares of judgement
And almost everyday
The shaking heads
Of disapproval say
"Pray for you to give me something then find out that there was nothing left. "

Rise Against - Audience of One


I can still remember the words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers in years of wet cement
The days blurred into each other, though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed, but then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then, we should have stayed

But we ran away, now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away, but what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one

Where have they gone?

Identities assume us as nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches to the seconds that we lost
I looked up and saw you, I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment in empathy

I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name

Rise Against - A Beautiful Indifference


There's a struggle coming but to conquer, first they must divide
The machines keep humming night and day
How are we so unaware?
Why are you not afraid?
Protests are drumming while you turn your nose and roll your eyes
Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained
Judging from an arm chair

'Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is light and there is dark and then there is us
And whether this world burns is none of your concern
Caught up in a ticker tape parade

I have learned to stand up and just to walk away (Hey, stand up)
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate (Hey, cold hearts)
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows, I am seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I'm here to stay

Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine
True colors shining through
As we are stripped of our exteriors

Chairs thrown and tables toppled
Hands armed with broken bottles
Standing no chance to win but
We're not running, we're not running

There's a point I think we're missing
It's in the air we raise our fists in
In the smiles we cast each other
My sister, my brother
About the time we gave up hoping
We'd ever find these locks still open
Stumbling on stones unturned
The hurt we feel, we all have earned
The lines we cross in search of change
But all they see is treason

Although we have no obligation to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors

Bonfires burn like beacons
Guiding the lost and weakened
Flames dance on crashing waves
Guiding ships who've gone astray
Time out, let's stop and think this through
We've all got better things to do
Than talk in circles, run in place
Answers {are} inches from our face

So come test me, so come break me
So come on intoxicate me
With hands tied behind my back, I fight
And wait for you to strike
A new problem we can't stop them
We're outnumbered and uncautioned
A rally cry rings out into the night

So pride yourself on what you are
And hold them all to words they can't take back
I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams
Where fires die but light still shines for us to see

What did you have to say?
Give me your logic, your definition
The words you twist to justify your position
Of mass starvation and blind air strikes
Every problem is solved with a fight
Peace won't be found til we're underground
As long as we live without a sound

"I don't love you anymore" is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed
'Cause my heart has been draining into the sea

Aren't getting me closer to what is left
Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know
Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?

Rise Against - Bricks


When faith alone is not enough
To keep our heads barely above
We look for reason and come up empty-handed
And when our children fight our wars
While we sit back just keeping score
We're teaching murder not understanding now

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
We sing for change

The lives our buried sons have laid
Will cancel debts we've yet to pay
How could we justify anything now
As long as we blindly obey and do exactly what they say
We'll have no one to blame but ourselves now

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands
We sing for change
You might also like
We run on the fumes of injustice
We'll never die with the fuel that you give us
Keep it coming cause I'm prepared to burn
Keep running from me at every turn
Your life around
(Into something true, into something true)
So turn your life around
(Into something true, something true)

We're setting the fires to light the way
We're burning it all to begin again
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hand
We sing for change

Rise Against - Bridges


In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long
There's a place that I'd rather be
There's a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, woah
Is where we let ourselves been led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under (Now sleep under)
We frame the doorways (We frame the doorways)
But may not pass through
The very same roads (The very same roads)
That we now wander (That we now wander)
The ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
Without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps its arms around
White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me, praying
She asks me for a favor
Catch me if I fall
You might also like
A rush of blood straight to the head, woah

Paved with our bare hands, hey

No, I never meant to hurt you
No, I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waitin' while the man said "Move along"
We lay the tracks down
But now they're rotted
Like a runaway train
We brace for the crash
We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
Like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap
We built the bridges, woah (Brace for the crash, built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (Brace for the crash, brace for the crash)
(Now we brace for the crash)
We built the bridges, woah (Brace for the crash, brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (Brace for the crash)
And underneath the shadows we now live

Hey man, now did you hear?
Your final days are near
In a free fall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky
A fate that we deserve
There's no escape, no
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors, ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are awake enough to shatter what we hate
Like broken mirrors, reflections of an unfamiliar face
Hey, hey!

Hey man, you got the time?
Hey, can I trouble you for a light?
Who, me? No, I'm not the old town crier

When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow
When our summers grow longer and winters won't snow
From the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still
When we've lost our will

That's how we'll know
This is not a test, we'll know
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace

When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved
And the buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
What more will it take

For us to know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
Kissing the ground as we all fall from grace

To bend or break the rules back into place

With perfect aim, we stand back and throw
Glass windows break and it's all about to blow
Lights go out as we pass the torch again
In hope that it stays lit
Neutrality means that you don't really care
Cause the struggle goes on even when you're not there
Blind and unaware

That's how we'll know
This is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all, yeah we all, all fall from grace

The bones of men that sought to overthrow
Or all that remains
Oh, what they stole was innocence
The slate once clean has gone as black as coal
Time and time again

Reflects inside a child's eye
This world

No self-control

No bleeding hearts, no long goodbyes

She got down on hands and knees
One ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something
But the dirt made not a sound tonight
Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores
Where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more
And so it goes
But still we give ourselves to this
We can't spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights in a prayer for dawn
But the daylight isn't what she wants
The concrete calls my name again
I'm falling, through the cracks I slip

The postcard says wish you were here but I'd rather I was there
Holding on to the simple things before they disappear
That's what I meant
But that was then and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Rise Against - Disparity by Design


All the way at the bottom of the barrels, we cry out
So ashamed of our tears that we blame only ourselves
That's when they win, they keep us convinced
To lift up our chins, these playing fields are level
"We all have a chance", with that they dismiss
The fast lanes they rode
On which access depends on who you know
Or where you came from
Whose daughter are you? Whose fortunate son?
We're told to stick out our thumbs
They feast from the linens while we settle for crumbs

Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
(A just reparation)

All the way from the towers, high above glass ceiling tombs
Tell themselves that they've earned this
By working hard and playing by the rules
But this is only part-true
A dangerous trick played on me and you
And so, like a practical joke
We've pulled on these bootstraps so hard that they broke

But will you believe them

And if there's a god, you better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes

But if we just took a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps a man in the gutter
Is not so different from you
Come in, out of the cold
Forget all that you know
Because there's always been room by the fire for you
Oh, come in out of the cold
Will you believe them?
Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
We're fed these empty fairytales
And I'm through believing

And if walls could speak I'd pray
That they would tell me what to do

Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Are what keep me coming back to you

As their castles crumble slowly

The crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day that it began
'Cause it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start

But it happened once to me
And this will never be same

Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

And there's a fire on the borders
And it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger
And it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave

We want the motherfucking world and we want it now (Woah)
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
No, I don't wanna wait
I know a better way
So step aside, come on
Or better yet, just go away
Our chance has finally come
There might not be another one now
No, we're not gonna wait, we want it now
Yeah, we're dousing the flames, we want it now

Rise Against - Hairline Fracture


A sinking ship, an awkward kiss
A chance to set things straight
The kind of hurt that burns and burns
Like fires we can't contain
We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there we'll wait
To start again with steady hands
This time nothing gets in our way
But as we peer a little closer what do we see?

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against?)

A promise kept
The dirt unswept
A poorly worn disguise
A child unloved that then grows up
To love what we despise
We're broken but still breathing
We are wounded but we are healing
We pick up right where we left off
Breathe on the ashes that remain
So that these coals may become fire
To guide our way
You might also like
A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)

I walk on wounds
That seldom prove to slow me down
I laugh this constant pain away
So you can't tell
But there it lies under the smiles
It drains me mile after mile
But seldom proves to slow me down
Here I go, here I go, here I go
Should we just hold on
To what remains of
What we thought was lost

But it's just a crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against?)

He said, "Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say, if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"
I said, "That sounds pretty good"
Black leather boots, spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair, but it looks alright
We marched and we sang, we all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands
The children, they cried, but I got my man
We took him away, a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes, they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop, but then I joined in
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once
But again and again

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop, I begged her to stay
But she pressed on, so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust
He said, "Son
Have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say
If I said that you could?"

Can there be a road that takes us home?

We toe the line (toe the line)

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms, the skies as grey as leaves

But the people laughed and swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave way as if to agree
When it rains it pours

The life that we once owned, first bought, then sold
Like messengers of war, we've no control

I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, "Move!"
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn

How many walls can you put up?
How many guns 'til you feel safe?
How many times can we watch this story over, and over, and over again?
And how many years have we wasted counting the lies that we've been fed?
There's something to change
We have waited over, and over, and over again
I'm entertained by the monkey on your back
Can we still call it a joke if no one laughs?
It's either going up in smoke around me, or according to plan
A bittersweet disaster melting over, and over again
How many walls can you put up?
How many guns 'til you feel safe?
How many times can we watch this story over, and over, and over again?
How many years have we wasted counting the lies that we've been fed?
There's something to change
We have waited over, and over, and over again
Chasing our own tail
The more we learn, the less we know
As the monsters lost in history
Are now making their return
As we bow down
Roll up the carpet, red as rose
We should have known

Rise Against - I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore


On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's beck and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around
I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone (We will all be gone)
Won't back down, won't take no for answers anymore (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
These walls close, we pace back and forth

You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
As the light turns off inside your heart can you remember
What it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us, I cherish just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave
Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

This grip loosens but it never breaks
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall
And now I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever, until forever ends
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

Don't let me go

This is Noyes

Down beyond these city streets through gutters filled with black debris
In alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight
Down through the scrapers of the sky past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car, “Are you happy where you are?”

Blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Let's go!

And so we carry on each day as if our lives are not so grey
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
Brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality

Dead-bolt turns, doors creak open
Whispers and moonlight there to guide

While the world sleeps we are awake

While the gathering swells, the flames grow tall right before us
As drums keep pounding and the masses now are fusing
Bodies pressed and tangled
As we revel in confusion

Where the vultures circle on winds that blow
From northern skies that haunt these waking moments
On shadows cast by the mountain range
On calloused soles, we find our way
Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon
While this sun is rising

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
And we are alone under this sun
And we want to fix the work that you've undone

When cries for help go unanswered
And signal fires just burn and burn

Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
With the constant drone of the unfulfilled
But we'll never fall if we stand for something

From the nation under God

One last thing I beg you, please
Just before you go
I've watched you fly on paper wings
Halfway 'round the world until they burned up in the atmosphere
Sent you spiraling down
Landing somewhere far from here
With no one else around
To catch you falling down
And I'm looking at you now

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I

"Swing for the fences, son", he must have told you once
But that was a conversation you took nothing from
So raise your glass now
Let's celebrate exactly what you've done
Just put off another day of knowing where you're from
You can catch up with yourself, if you run

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour

There's something wrong with the words that we're not sayin'
And the silence we're creatin'
Like a ghost note symphony
There's something wrong and the temperature is risin'
Ignoring every siren
As we're marching towards the cliff
But these are choices that we don't have to make
Block out the voices
'Cause they have led you astray
What I've been trying to say to you is that
There's something in the water
There must be something in the air
Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it
It doesn't mean that - that it's not there
Yeah, we are all turned on
But then we all tuned out
As we are hypnotised by the sparkling lies
We fall under their spell
But don't forget that these are choices (choices)
That we don't have to make
So many voices (voices)

And we are the hourglass
Love like a flame that can't be held
Somewhere beyond the lives we burn
Lies the point of no return
Like the sand within an hourglass
(But there is something odd!

We sink or swim or just float
We all die
Yeah, but did we live at all?

As we spin... on dance floors made of ice
So rest your hand in mine
Steady now, ignore the sound
Of breaking lines
The crack beneath our feet as time runs out

Each night like a white noise frequency
Broadcast the waves, I tune them out
Clear signs outlined, but I couldn't see
What I see now

I should've said something to you
When I saw you walk away
Instead, I did nothing
And now
You're gone and it's too late
So we board up the windows we used to look through

Invisible, but growing underneath
Pushing out

Hold on slow down again from the top now and tell me everything
I know I've been gone for what seems like forever
But I'm here now waiting
To convince you that I'm not a ghost or a stranger
But closer than you think
She said just go on
To what you pretend is your life
But please don't die on me

Wings won't take me
Heights don't faze me
So take a step
But don't look down

Now I'm standing on the rooftop, ready to fall
I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall

Perpetual motion, the image won't focus
A blur is all that's seen
But here in this moment like the eye of a storm
It all came clear to me
I found a shoulder to lean on
An infallible reason to live all by itself
I took one last look from the heights that I once loved
And then I ran like hell

To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the streets
Chased down like dogs, we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you

I won't believe the lies that hide the truth

Welcome home
While away
They have tampered with the locks
And your things they rearranged
"We propose a better way"
Said the note they left behind
In their wake of disarray
You fell in place
Don't fall asleep
They'll find us here
I know a place to disappear
As a voice proclaimed

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are till the day we die
Or till we don't have the strength to go on
Till we don't have the strength to go on

Let us cry
Let us be
Let us open up our hearts
Without fear of anything

Is all we need
To traverse this burning bridge

What smiles betray
Your sad sad eyes gave you away
And don't you know?

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are till the day we die
Or till we don't have the strength to go on
Till we don't have the strength to go on

Our shoulders bear an awful weight
But still we trudge on just the same
Our colors run then leave a stain
They blacken our once honest name
But how can we argue? Tell me
Over the fury and the fire
How many times can we tell you that we
Are not like you, we see right through
Your poor disguise that fails to fool
The wary eye that's trained on you
What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are till the day we die
Or till we don't have the strength to go on
Till we don't have the strength to go on
What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are till the day we die

Rise Against - Whereabouts Unknown


To the ends of this lost world
You have marched and you have sworn
To a tainted crown of thorns
As the hungry sails unfurl
We are thrusted from the shore
And it's you that we search for

The blackest night
The midnight sun
The covered tracks and days spent on the run
The strangers we've become

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

Another place, another time
We toed the same side of the line
Yeah we saw eye to eye
Even then the saddest sounds
Were nothing laughter could not drown
But we are not laughing now

Our silence is broken
It's all right

Swallow the sun, erase the sky
An invitation that's been declined
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Your whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken

Rise Against - Worth Dying For


Set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race
Let's go!
Take a breath and explode like bullets tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade that tries to separate the skin
Now in the
White flames of burning flags we
Found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that we don't feel anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?

Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
Feel me rise in the strength I've found inside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow
Like a glacier melting watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world but all I found was hate
Now in the

Found a world worth dying for, yeah

These things I've never faced
Scratch out, but won't erase
In the wreckage of a job well done

And that moment I refused to close my eyes anymore

Rise Against - Zero Visibility


I'm settlin' in here for the long haul
"Can't hide forever" is what they say
In with the wind, out with a bang (In, out, in, out)
Meanwhile nothing has changed

With each word slowly uttered
A storm brews in her eyes
A missed shot at the buzzer
Time whether wasted or well spent is still time

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

Moments of clarity here are short lived
Bleed through the bandages again
And when is a lie no longer white
But black as a day without sun?
You might also like
I'm passed out in a gutter
Woke up in your arms
Nursed back and recovered
The same touch that heals me (Heals me)

We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

And the world works in ways that I never
Have claimed to know
We got out in front of the weather
But it followed
And the view from here isn't better
But it's all we know
It's all we know

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the edge of the borderlines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
Who we become you won't recognize
But we became them all together
All together

Simply because you can breathe
Doesn't mean you're alive
Or that you really live
This life has taken its toll
She just doesn't know
How much more she can give

But here at the top of the world
Where I raise my hands, and I clench my fists
And they stand before me, below
Demanding the answers with flips of a switch

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply ingrained in your head
(That this world is) something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less

But it involves black masks and gasoline
One day I'll turn these thoughts into screams

Breathe deep and easy, swallow this pride
Stare at my shaking hands through bone-dry, blood-shot eyes
Clock strip the hours, I count the miles
Will you be there waiting, awake until sunrise?

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days
I crawled from the sink-holes, collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight?

In the glow of twilight, our world is finally calm
I felt it complete me, when the stars give way to dawn
A language universal, but I speak not its tongue
Is this a night that spans forever or a dawn that never comes?

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days
I crawled from the sink-holes, collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight?

Tomorrow we might wake in servitude and silence
I will give you everything if only you would have me
Tomorrow we will sweat and toil
Our hands will quiver, caked with soil
Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance
But tonight we dance
But tonight we dance!

Rise Against - Endgame


And on that day they'll tell you
That life hummed on with no clue
The warning signs were all dismissed or shouted down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
On what would then befall the only life we'd know
Were they burning signal fires to guide us to the fields?
Or building funeral pyres? The outcome of a final appeal

The city lines are down, the kerosene's run out
The fracturing of all we relied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin and start to feel again
Cause all the shoulders on which to cry are gone

The paranoia gripped us, the rain turned engines to rust
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We bet on finite genius or prayed for gods to save us
But there was no antidote, disease tore us apart
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel

"All I need is what I have"
Then fell a tear of happiness
She watched the world crumble away
"Is this the end of yesterday?"
"Lord, I hope so." is all he said
All gone are the old guards
Gone are the cold, cold wars
Weightless we go forth
On wings of amnesty
Oh, we relied on now

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
The weight that we once felt is gone

Entered the war from over the sea

When his faith has been put to the test, the call to arms he heeds
On the 8th of October he went, made a sergeant for his deeds
Fearless, leading the raid of the war, machine gun on the hill
Charge the enemy taking the prisoners by power of his will

Sabaton - The Art of War


If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle

I stand alone
And gaze upon the battlefield
Wasteland
Is all that's left after the fight
And now I'm searching a new way to defeat my enemy
Bloodshed
I've seen enough of death and pain

I will run - they will hunt me in vain
I will hide - they'll be searching
I'll regroup - feign retreat they'll pursue
Coup de grâce
I will win but never fight

That's the Art of War!
That's the Art of war!

Breaking the will to fight among the enemy
Force them to hunt me
They will play my game
And play by my rules
I will be close but still untouchable
No more will I see suffering and pain
You might also like
They will find me no more
I'll be gone
I will have them surrounded
They will yield without fight overrun
Coup de grâce
I will win but never fight

That's the Art of War!
That's the Art of War!

Broken and lost
Tired of war
They'll surrender to me
Caught in my trap
There's no way out
Fail never again (never again)

I will run - they will hunt me in vain
I will hide - they'll be searching
I'll regroup - feign retreat they'll pursue
Coup de grâce
I will win but never fight
That's the Art of War!
That's the Art of war!
That's the Art of war!

Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting

There and back again, bullets all around

His fear held at bay, as he carried them away

Sabaton - Burn Your Crosses

No use to pray, there's no one listening
I will die anyway
Some say I've killed, some call me Satan
Now my blood must be spilled
I'm sentenced for crimes I did not commit
I'll pay with my blood, is this really it?
Creations of God?
No way!
Burn your crosses, make way for science
Christ has only caused death and violence
Burn your crosses and make way for yourself
Put faith in mother earth
Don't call his name, don't trust in others
Bishops fighting for fame
Torture in vain. I won't surrender
Purified by pain
Mankind's great mistake was to create God
Creation of man. Excuse to spill blood
Creations of God?
No way!
Burn your crosses, make way for science
Christ has only caused death and violence
Burn your crosses and make way for yourself
Put faith in mother earth

Dying ain't no disgrace
My last night alive has come to an end
Death once I feared, but now it's my friend
Creation of God?
No way!
Burned my crosses, make way for science
Christ will only cause death and violence
Burned my crosses and made way for myself
In mother earth I trust
Now burn!

Sabaton - Camouflage


I was a P.F.C. on search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
It was the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out all alone
I could hear the enemy moving in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait."
Charlie wants to tango, now he'll have two to dance"
I said: "Well, thanks!", I told him my name and asked him his
And he said: "The boys just call me Camouflage"

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

Well, we fought all night, side by side, took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
And it was near the riverbank when the ambush came
And I thought this was the end, and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And then the big Marine, he just swat it with his hand
Just like it was a fly...

When he led me outta danger I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle then he was gone
When I got back to my H.Q., I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big Marine named Camouflage
When I said his name, a soldier gulped, and a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said "You may be telling the truth, boy, but this here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed away last night
But before he went, he said Semper Fi, and said his only wish
Was to save a young Marine caught in a mirage"
"So here, take his dog tag, son, I know he'd want you to have it now"

Until now they were mainly observing
There in the wheat fields and a small piece of land

Clouds are gathering in the darkness
Lightning strikes the Earth
Evil forces celebrate
Lucifer's rebirth

Necromancers, sacrifices
He'll be here for sure
Drained blood from a thousand men
And now he's back for more

He will rise from a world down under
Bringing fire, plague, death and thunder
Summons creatures unknown to mankind
Demons of the past

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane

Satan's hordes are coming closer
Now it's time to pay
Riding on the wings of death
Searching for their prey

Seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
Back on earth again

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane
Demons marked with the five-edged star
Haunt our dreams in this endless war
Killing children, raping women
Now it's time to die

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane

Sabaton - The End of the War to End All Wars


Death, hard to ignore
One million lost five months into the war
Pain, fell one by one
Three years remained, it had only begun
Unable to restore
A map redrawn
Unlike what came before
The future of warfare has dawned

Do what must be done
Send off your son, life cut short by a gun
Gas, cover the fields
Gone with the wind, reveal lethal ideals

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

Sabaton - Fields of Verdun


As the drum roll started on that day
Heard a hundred miles away
A million shells were fired
And the green fields turned to grey
The bombardment lasted all day long
Yet the forts were standing strong
Heavily defended, now the trap's been sprung and the battle has begun

Descend into darkness
303 days below the sun

Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun
Nowhere to run, father and son
Fall one by one under the gun
Thy will be done, and the judgement has begun
Nowhere to run, father and son
Fall one by one, fields of Verdun

Though a million shells have scarred the land
No one has the upper hand
From the ground above to trenches
Where the soldiers make their stand
As the trenches slowly turn to mud
And then quickly start to flood
Death awaits in every corner
As they die in the mud, fill the trenches with blood

For his falseness and his crimes
Strike him down and slay his guards
And his ministers as well
Done it your way, now you will pay
Debts with your own blood
Hail to the king that brought peace to us all
Rise from your grave, hear our call
We'll not forget that you once saved our land
Killed by your own brothers hand
Hail to the king

Sabaton - Hearts of Iron

See the Reich in flames
Try to save Berlin in vain
It’s a road through death and pain
On the other shore, there’s the end of the war
Who could ever have believed
Seems like nothing’s been achieved
Just to walk a day, go all the way, the fronts are closing in
As the end is drawing near, the 12th army interfere
Open up a route, get people out, it’s forces spread out thin
It’s the end of the war
Hold the corridor!
Reach for Elbe’s shore
It’s the end, the war has been lost
Keeping them safe ’til the river’s been crossed
Nicht ein Schlacht, ein Rettungsaktion
Holding their ground ’til the final platoon
“Hurry up, we’re waiting for you”
Men of the 9th, and civilians too
Dispossessed, surrendering to the west
Who’ll survive and who will die?
Up to Kriegsglück to decide
Those who made it cross, without a loss, have reason to reflect
It is not about Berlin, it is not about the Reich
It’s about the men, who fought for them, what peace can they expect?

Rulers come and rulers go, will our kingdom fall apart?
Who shall we now turn to, when our leaders lost their heart?
Lives are lost but at what cost, will the grand dream fall apart?

Killed by his own or by his foes, turned the tide
300 years still no one knows, the secret remains

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand
Long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland
Long live Carolus Rex

Brought him back to Sweden, where we put him in a chest
Years of war and agony, now the king can finally rest
What will be uncovered, from that cold November night?

Dropped down to a world of ice
A plateau of frozen lakes
A Nazi place of doom in their sights
Training camps on Scottish Heights
To commando saboteurs
A mission of their lives lies ahead
Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold
Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war
Allied time was running short
They would race against the bomb
And hours turned to days, time passed on
As the nature test their strength
They would fight through night and day
To live amongst the wild, stay alive

Bringing an end to the slaughter
Winds are changing, head on north

Sabaton - Uprising


Warsaw, rise!

Do you remember when, when the Nazis forced their rule on Poland?
1939 and the Allies turned away
From the underground rose the hope of freedom as a whisper
City in despair - but they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
They were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
Was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came.
Calling Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you, Warszawo Walcz!

Spirit, soul and heart
In accordance with the old traditions
1944, still the Allies turned away
Fighting street to street in a time of hope and desperation
Did it on their own and they never lost their faith

Sabaton - We Burn


I've had a vision, it's clear to me now
I know what has to be done
Different religions cannot share a land
A plague and I have the cure

Chase them down, let them suffer in pain
Dig them down, they'll be gone for a while
Evidence lost

We burn
Plunder and rape
Show them no mercy, just burn
Flesh turn to ash

Inspired by deeds that were done long ago
I know what has to be done
Filth of my land must be washed clean and pure
Now let the cleansing begin

Genocide?
Who will drag me to court?
There's no crime if you do not get caught
I am the law

Sabaton - Wehrmacht


Pulled into war to serve a vision
That's supposed to last a thousand years
Part of a machine unstoppable
As merciless as tidal waves
Were they the victims of the time
Or proud parts of larger goals?
Propaganda of the Reich
Masterful machine
Time and again the battle rages on
Beyond the gates of misery
As casualties rise and millions die around them
Did they see it all?
Crazy madmen on a leash
Or young men who lost their way?
Grand illusions of the Reich
May seem real at times

Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?

Sabaton - White Death


Almost night, a crimson horizon
Painting thousand lakes red
As your army approach in the east
A hunter is switching his prey
All alone, a man with his gun
Wanders into the wild
Tracks you down, you cannot hide
Once he's onto your trail

Enter the night, a flash in the darkness
White Death is heading your way
The fear of his foes, a hero at home
Hundreds will fall by his gun

You're in the sniper's sight
The first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullet's way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye

After the dawn when morning is broken
Snow once white turn to red
Blood red snow tells what happened last night
A tale of a sniper is born
Snow in mouth hiding his breath
He is steady at hand
Eye to eye target in sight
The moment to fire has come
You might also like
Hundreds of kills, a man and his rifle
Embody the sisu of Finns
Stay out of sight and cover your head
When he pulls the trigger, you're dead

Time to die
You're in the bullet's way
The White Death's prey

Sabaton - Winged Hussars


When the winged hussars arrived

A cry for help in time of need, await relief from holy league
60 days of siege, outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky, wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down they turned the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Cannonballs are coming down from the sky
Janissaries, are you ready to die?
We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye
You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate
On this field you're only facing our hate
But, back home the sultan's sealing your fate


We remember
In September
That's the night Vienna was freed
We made the enemy bleed!
Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrived
Coming down they turned the tide

Storm clouds, fire and steel
Death from above, make their enemy kneel
Shining armour and wings
Death from above, it's an army of kings
We remember
In September
When the winged hussars arrived

Sabaton - The Beast

You can hear the thunder
Long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow
Creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes
Don't try to play you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast
You won't hear a footstep
Coming up on you
Moving like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business
He is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's coming true
There is nothing you can say
No way to change, he won't delay
This Cain will have his feast

Sabaton - The Hammer Has Fallen


Here I am standing, darkness all around
Thinking of past, taking my last breath
Air is cold as ice
No one close to hear my voice
Didn't leave me with a choice
Heaven will you wait for me?

Will I find a way? Will I find a place?
Will you let me go in peace?
Will I find a way to the other side?

Sad are memories from the life I lived
Cannot go on, cannot go further
It has to end right here
For the things that I have done
All the girls I lost and won
Let me rest in peace at last

Will I find a way? Will I find a place?
Will you let me go in peace?
Leave behind those dark days
Now I ask again will you hear my cries?
Then you realize why, oh why
I must find a way to the other side
You might also like
Hear them whisper, calling out my name

Will you let me go in peace?
Leave behind those dark days

Now there's a standstill in the war
Repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end
A few will transcend
They were under twenty five
And under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born
Their enemies scorn

A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise

Jägers led the way
The pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained
Advancement sustained

Back in Europe then straight to France

Through the Somme and the Devil's Wood

Born a soldier, enjoyed the war

I won't be coming home
I won't be going anywhere
I will guard this post forever
Here on the alpine slope, where I did my final stand I shall remain
Among the ice and snow that binds me to this mountain

A force of nature too strong, sent from above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

Stairway to heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never

Sabaton - Versailles


The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontline
People have asked the question:
What is the price of peace?
How many more must die?
Exactly five years after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand
Germany is forced to sign an unconditional surrender
For the signing of this historical document
The French city of Versailles is chosen

Signed a treaty to change the world
Tеnsions fall and the peace unfurlеd
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war
Signed a treaty to change the world
Tensions fall and a peace is unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war

A fragile but hopeful peace falls upon the European continent
America returns to their shores
Russia tend to their own matters
And the British Empire disbands their colonial forces
Parades are being held in victorious countries
The war that would end all wars is over
But not everyone agrees
In the underground, something is growing in the dark
Because for some, the war never ended
War will never entirely die
It will evolve, it will change
And war will return
Sooner than we think

Long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The Kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the '93

Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?

Father of toxic gas and chemical warfarе
His dark creation has been revealеd
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield

"Perversions of ideals of science"
Lost words of alienated wife
And in the trenches of the western front
Unknowing soldiers pay the price
And on the battlefield they're dying
And on the fields the crops are grown
So who can tell us what is right or wrong
Maths or morality alone?

Soilwork - Spectrum of Eternity


I feel I’m done with this shell of mine
Separated from the one I knew
I’ll kill every minute on hold
While the ocean brings me back to life
I’ve lived, I’ve breathed
I’ve learned to be deceived
Sheltered for what it’s worth
Forced to make it work
I feel I’m chosen to see
What others haven’t seen
It’s not a tragedy, it’s just reality
But how it makes me believe

Now I see a spectrum of eternity
The remedy is yours
A thousand of demands
A never-ending glance of fate
Of fate
I’m yours, I’m yours

Three years since I was reborn
A brutal insight
Never knew it could do
So much to stir my soul up
You might also likeIt’s been relentless
I’ve felt deprived of my own life
Stuck on the other side
Of who I was enlightened by

Embrace me
For one last time take me there
Something’s out there
And it won’t lead me astray


Embrace me
For one last time take me there

Embrace me
For one last time take me there

And it won’t lead me astray

Of fate
I'm yours, I'm yours

Soilwork - This Momentary Bliss


My eyes are bleeding
They’ve searched for someone else
Addicted to the hunt
Then end up somewhere else
Where the expendable souls go
There must be more to this
I’m right in here
Staring through a glass wall
I tell you this my friend
We must be bigger
Than momentary bliss

Don’t let the light you see restrain you
Don’t put your trust in the dark outside
There will be more than you ever could die for
This momentary bliss is a lie
(Cause my eyes they are bleeding)

I’m off to treasure a brand new emotion
I’m taking off like a demon of fate
I reckon something will see my devotion
For I may be the one to get closer
Closer to what lies beneath
I’m gazing right into a well of redemption (of redemption)

Soilwork - The Ride Majestic


From the deepest of waters to a burning sky
I've been dragged through golden aisles of everyday malice
Sometimes a whisper ain't enough
Sometimes it's all you need
Past times will wake your reasons up
A world you've been spared to believe
As it shows
I could've been dreaming
Through all of this
I know it never goes
The way you were raised to kneel and perceive

The words, the shadows, the way
You all just left me to be
Bring me fortune as I die

When they call for me
Saying, "Son, you're heartless"
I won't believe it
The ride majestic
How can it cease when I transcend?
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away
You might also like
Never think it'll be over
It moves in circles
Changing shapes and throwing you back to where it all began
I've earned my right
I've earned my shelter
Now let me move on
Sometimes the strive is all in vain
Sometimes it gets you there

The skies, the darkness, the sea
You all just showed me the way
Bring the fortune I've denied
As I die

Carry my message (carry my message)
The sky declined (the sky declined)
Marry the fire (marry the fire)
If it still hurts bring it forth to those deprived
(When they call for me)

When they call for me
Saying, "Son, you're heartless."
I won't believe it
The ride majestic (majestic)
How can it cease when I transcend?
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away
When they call for me
Saying, "Son, you're heartless."

Soilwork - Nerve


Call it liberation or frustration
As it hits like a bomb
Tearing you apart as you're first in line
Entering the zone
Watch how it runs
A nerve-wrecking resistance
Watch how it burns
A venomous script's getting formed

You've travelled a long way to get here...
And now it's waking you up
Waking you up!

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn

Watch how it runs, watch how it burns
And it's all a deception
Break it and learn, there's no return
For a presence like mine

Without a look inside, inside

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn
Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution

Now did you hear the sound
Ascending from the ground?
I pray for those who stayed
Or died along the way
We trust the trembling air
To take us anywhere
Transcending gravity
And hoping that we'll be set free

We drift towards
The darkness of our heavens (Drift away)
Unbound instantly

A memory set to flame
Like all I left behind
Becoming someone else

Got my blessings from a death diviner
Cut my shackles with the force of life

Oh, and left me drained
Fox-feline furs and cane room dividers
Huddling silently until her ghost
Was whisked away
Oh, but I remained

When the skies remained an empty threat above me
But the weight of everything that came to pass
Brought me down to kneel before the death diviner
In the hope that she would make me free at last

My reflection in her eyes drew up
My twisted past

AC/DC - You Shook Me All Night Long


She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

Gamma Ray - Anywhere in the Galaxy


Staring out the window
At places in the starlit horizon
I'm waiting in the darkness
For arrival
But the sands of my time are running low
Running low
Woah...

Lost and stranded, far away from home
Peeping through window in the darkness
Parted in our hearts
Glowing, turning circles where we go
No, they won't let go, let go
Blind our souls with raging, burning madness

Out in the heavens, we're ready to fight
Too late to cry
The final conclusion is roaring inside
Too proud to die

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of Mars
Is shining for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see
The world will long for liberty
The fallen heroes calling me
Anywhere in the galaxy

The final conclusion is roaring inside
Too proud to die

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of Mars

Time is right for us to see
The world will long for liberty
Fallen heroes calling me
Anywhere in the galaxy

We will fight for our destiny
Anywhere in the galaxy
We will always run free
Anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy
Oh...


And now the story finally ends
With no disgrace for our survival
Outrageous fury in my hands
And turning circles turn no more

Too late to cry
Out in the heavens, we're ready to fight
Too proud to die
The final conclusion is roaring inside

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of Mars

Gamma Ray - Armageddon


Now, all you sinners, this is the prophecy
The revelation of your own destiny
You had a dream once
A dream that you have sold
And now, my brothers
Annihilation is foretold
Yeah!

Will you remember ancient times
When we rode across the air
When the day of judgment comes?
And when your world is gonna blow
Through your heart and take your soul
In the twilight of the sun

I believe there's no tomorrow
When we all will sink in sorrow
When the day of judgment finally comes

It's the end of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgment will come
Won't you help me now?
You might also like
Now, tell me, Mother Earth
Oh, we went wrong
In the heart of everyone
Do you remember how it had begun?
In the desert in the twilight of the sun
All dead and gone
Can you heal me? I am not the only one
Can you feel me? I don't want to be undone
I'm everyone

Save me from this living hell
I don't wanna know another tale
Someone, help me through this on the way
Hear me now

It's the end of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgment will come
Won't you help me now?

All God's creation is finally dead and gone
Our revelation, the day of judgment comes
Forevermore, I stand alone
The final fury has begun
When the day has come

Guardians of the monsters of the Earth
Take our lives away
And you forever will be cursed
Keepers of the darkness in this world
We will not surrender to the evil of your birth
Hope will never die
And the clear, blue, sunny sky
Will ease the pain
Guardians of the monsters of the Earth


Lead us not into the temptation
Save us from revelations

I stand alone, I stand alone
I stand alone, inside my head

No one can hear, no one can hear
No one can hear my little word
Holy Father, take me on your wings of love
I wish that I could be forever free, oh, yeah

It's the end of the world as we know it
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgment has...
End of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgment has come
Won't you help me now?

Now, all you sinners
This is the prophecy
The revelations of your own destiny
Sleep well and dream on
The dream that you have sold
And now, my brothers
This world is slowly getting cold

Gamma Ray - Avalon


Walking through the mists again
Avalon, seem caught forever
I don't know where I belong
Holding on and waiting
Eternity, a lonely grave
From the haze of time, I'm calling
Is our journey to begin
Or am I only dreaming?

In a land far away from here
Like a star that's blinding
Heaven's magic silently appeared
And I'm leaving for the dawn

Is it true that I must sleep
Forevermore, just watching changes?
Heaven knows the story is not over
And the knights will gather

Out in the cold, so long forgotten
Leaving the past behind
So timeless we're here, and we shall reappear
To find god
You might also like
From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
From Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So, rise from Avalon

Now has come the point of no return
And I'm feeling fire, fill my veins
The torches start to burn
And the quest is starting

It's up to you to be forgotten
Saddle the horses now
The mindless shall fear when we all reappear
To rise up

From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
Rise from Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So, rise from Avalon
Thirteen Knights to reappear
Merlin, can you, can you hear?
Can you see the past and the tomorrow?
Tell me, can we now succeed?
Find the grail and turn the key
Find a better future for us all
Ride on out and make the world
Brighter than a shiny pearl
For all
Heaven knows I wait for thee
Give my love eternally
I'm calling, calling for you

On an island in the sun
Only wait for things to come
Never think about tomorrow
Building castles in the sand
Wait for you to take my hand
Without fear and without sorrow

From the land of make-believe
Comes the faith of the unbeliever
And the eyes of god have turned away
From Avalon
And belief is the holy grail
Of the fool and the mass deceiver
Turning good into evil deeds
So rise... Avalon

In the morning sun
Our journey has begun
Don't close your eyes and turn away
Put an end to all the grief
To the pain from the make-believe
Don't close your eyes and turn away
In the land of the unbeliever
Tear the mask of the mass deceiver
Don't close your eyes and turn away
In the rays of the morning sun
Our journey has begun
Don't close your eyes and turn away

Someone is out there; he's watching what I do
From far in the distance, his eyes everywhere
I look around me; there's no one that I see
But still, I feel someone's controlling my mind

Save your breath and run

Resurrecting paradise, cry for freedom
Killing pain, a million lies

Sowing the seeds of pain
All see the darkened skyline

Too many people, too much trouble
Too many problems in the morn
Another sunrise in the rubble
Another ship sunk by the storm

Some little angel tries to tell me that it's over
It's just a bad reflection from above
The load upon my shoulders
Makes me even stronger, even bolder
Oh, no, no, I haven't had enough

Heaven can wait till another day
'Cause there ain't no reason to leave
The world is a stage where we all can play
Another fine reason to live
And heaven can wait, heaven can wait

Each day, a new reason to give up
Each day, another reason to sigh

Voices are calling from somewhere below
Melting on the eastern shore
Rain is falling down on me
Been waiting for eternity...
I'll be there!
Freedom for us all!

And I wonder why, why my heart still yearns
And I wonder why, why the earth still turns
And I wonder why, why the sky turns black
Still, I wonder why, but there is no turning back, yeah

For all eternity, for all the world to see
We're riding high across the wind
And when the storm begins to wash away all sins
We'll find a place where we'll begin

There's something wrong with the world today
Only the people that are fighting for...
...A better place in the world today
They don't believe that they have gone too far
...They're falling down

...And the earth still turns, but I'm on my way
He is on the way, as my heart still yearns
...I'm on my way; now he is on the way
And I cry for more
Yes, I'm on my way; now he is on the way
Gonna find the secret wall

I have seen the secret dreams
Of those who know eternity
And makes me feel like a shadow sneaking in
In my sleep, I'm searching for a way to find
The open door leading me to where it all begins

There's something wrong with the world today
Only the people that are fighting for...
...A better place in the world today
They don't believe that they have gone too far
...They're falling down

Here, the world has gone astray... revolution
Now, the time has come to pray... hallelujah
Deep, inside our minds, we wait... for rebellion
Here in dreamland, we will not obey the masters


So, now I'm riding through the air
Going to where no one dares
On the way, I'll cross the line forevermore
For once in life, I do not care
Nothing matters, now I dare
On the ride, I'll cross the line
Forever to be free


Have no fear: Rebellion is here!
Have no fear: Rebellion is here!
Have no fear: Rebellion is here!
Have no fear: Rebellion is here!

Confidence abused and torn away

And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

(You're not the only one, you're not the only one)
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?

Guns N’ Roses - Civil War


What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
You might also like

D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said, "Peace could last forever"?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no


Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't wanna hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no woah, no woah
What's so civil 'bout war anyway?

Linkin Park - Bleed It Out


Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!

I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away

Linkin Park - Breaking the Habit


Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Linkin Park - Crawling


Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting (Reacting)
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem

Linkin Park - From the Inside


I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit

Linkin Park - New Divide


I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash as time began to blur
Like a startling sign, that fate had finally found me

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole, connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in between where we were standing

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty

Can you feel the beat of a thousand marching feet
Searching for passion in a lifeless dead-end street
They're breaking down the wall
They're knocking at the door
Searching for a soul that gives them more

When the music dies, the apparitions of melody will rise
All that's said and done, will haunt us one by one
The spirit of the heart will carry on

Are you listening to the voices as they scream
Calling to the masses with the drone of sleepless dreams
They're coming to your house
They're crawling up the stairs
Searching for a saint who really cares

I had the strangest dream
You were lost at sea
I found you drowning on the ocean floor
I woke from my deep sleep to end the misery
I found you lying outside of my door
I tried to wake you up
To shake you up
And found out you were dead
Like a leaf in the wind you left me standing alone
To face the demons in my head

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive

A dusty record spins
An old song plays again
The needle drags across it's skin
Ink spills through my pen
The paper soaks it in
The music bringing tremors to my hands
I can't just give you up
Just lift you up to chance on a dragon fly's wings
With my love in the wind you left me standing alone
Hoping it brings you back to me

Kids in the Way - Moving Mountains


Bridges are burning, heads are turning
To a sky that's painted red
Your voice grows calm inside my head
Cars are crashing, buildings collapsing
And you're whispering in my ear
Come with me my dear

Like rushing water, our praises are to you
Like roaring thunder our voices shake the earth
We're moving mountains, just to get to you

Kids in the Way - My Little Nightmare


Hey baby, I just might be my own worst enemy
But if I'm gonna regret this night
I won't go down without a fight
I got a dream that you can't see
I got a soul that you can't reach
And there's no time for another chance
The song died on our last dance

There's no time for falling apart
I need you like a bullet to the heart
So long, so you say (hey hey)
So long, so you say (hey hey)

Hey baby, there's no reason
That will keep me from leaving
'Cause I'm tired of watching you
Dragging skeletons through the room
I got a voice that you won't hear
I got a song that's never clear
And there's no time for another note
It's such a shame but we gave it a g-g-go

There's no time for falling apart
I need you like a bullet to the heart
So long, so you say (hey hey)
So long, so you say (hey hey)

Kids in the Way - Never Say Die


Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say
Don't let those dying ships sail away
Promise me you'll never say die

Whispers in the wind carry messages to lovers far
Tales of lost romance and of that missed chance
And fleeting hearts

Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say
Don't let those dying ships sail away
Promise me you'll never say die

Ashes in the sand bury witnesses of broken hearts
Scars of lone memories and of those crushed dreams
And open arms

Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say
Don't let those dying ships sail away
Promise me you'll never say die

It's a bone cold night
I'm breathing in the air
It's freezing up my lungs
As I fight for words to share with you
To tell you what you've done to me
You ripped me from my set in stone complacency

Like a phoenix with a heartache
Now you're taking me away with you tonight
And I know that I can't fly
But when I'm in your arms, I'm holding up the sky

Kids in the Way - Sugar


She's a high fashion love assassin
Taking names and playing games is her passion
But her perfect world started coming apart
The day I broke her cold heart
Now she's hungry for the blood of any boy
And she'll get it 'cause she gets what she wants
She's a devil in black stilettos
Don't cross her, she's a fully loaded debutante

Everybody run, everybody run
She looks so sweet when she's having fun
Everybody run, everybody
The homecoming queen has got a gun

She's a killer made of spice and sugar
Hand grenades for promenades better suit her
But her perfect world started coming apart
The day I broke her cold heart
Now her enemy is our society
She'll suck you in, then she'll blow you away
She's a devil in black stilettos
Don't raise your glass, her cocktail's spiked with glycerin

Kids in the Way - These Are the Days


The cold October air is blowing in my hair
And I'm losing everything I never thought I would
Where is that old playground?
Where is that old sundown?
When I would come home late an hour or two

These are the days when we will see
All our yesterdays are memories
The tides will rise
The winds will turn
We are drowning and growing from the burn

The red October leaves hold on to barren trees
And frailty is where we became so strong
Where is that old gun fight?
Where is that old twilight?
When fire flies were on the run

These are the days when we will see
All our yesterdays are memories
The tides will rise
The winds will turn
We are drowning and growing from the burn

The Offspring - You're Gonna Go Far, Kid


Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away, take him out today
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew, it was really only you
And now you'll lead the way, show the light of day
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid, trust deceived

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

I know you want it too
The magic of the moment
Is what I've got for you
The heartbeat of this night is made to lose control
And there is something in your eyes that's longing for some more
Let us find together the beat we're looking for

The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul

Let's reach the top together
One night will never do
An exploding shot of pleasure

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
Tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want it any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

A place without a name
Under a burning sky
There's no milk and honey here
In the land of God
Someone holds a sign
It says we are human, too
And while the sun goes down
The world goes by
White dove
Fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry
Waves, big like a house
They're stranded on a piece of wood
To leave it all behind
To start again
But instead of a new life
All they find is a door that's closed
And they keep looking for
A place called hope

It burns into your heart the darkness that you fear
You were never free, and you never realized
And love is a word you've never heard
Your heart ain't cold 'cause it burns a desire to leave the mire

Take your breath till nothing's left
Scars of life upon your chest
And I know wherever it goes

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above
Yeah, we run, running in the dark
And we run till we fall apart
And we run till the heavens above

We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
Too late, we're gone, yeah, we outta here

This blood in my veins run cold when I think
It'll never be the same, but I never lose hope
This is my time now, no time for tears, celebrate
Put it in the air right now, never back down
You could never wear my crown 'cause it weigh too much
And I crush every motherfucking thing I touch
This is love, I've never loved so much
Get involved, make the world stand up
Give my life before I ever give up
"Name in lights", you lost all my trust
Now it's time to face all of us
Get in line 'cause they're calling us
And it feels so marvelous
Just take my hand and run

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above

Within Temptation - Dangerous


I know I won't change, I have tried
Was feeling so caged, hands tied
I can't find anything feeling so right
It's blinding all
The reaper is close, see death smile
A matter of time, can't deny
I won't turn around, 'round, 'round
This destiny's mine

The countdown has begun
The walls are falling down
My life is on the line
But freedom is mine

It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you're like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous

I know it's not safe, close my eyes
I search for the edge of Earth
'Cause that's the only place I'll ever find
That makes me whole
A thief in the night, out of sight
It's out there waiting to ignite
The fever will rise, rise, rise
Taking over my mind

It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous

Nothing matters anyhow
It's like I'm floating off the ground
Into the hands of air, I dive
Rays of life flashing by
Like the time is slowing down
When the world is out of sight
All the memories in my mind
Won't leave me behind

It's dangerous, dangerous
It's dangerous, dangerous
It's dangerous
It's dangerous to sacrifice
It makes your blood run to throw the dice
It's dangerous, it's what you're like
It's what you'll die for to live this life
We're going on and we'll never stop
We're going on 'til our worlds collide
It's dangerous, so dangerous, dangerous

Within Temptation - A Demon's Fate


You'll burn this time
Seeing the violence, it's speeding my mind
No one is saving you
How can you find a heaven in this hell?

Leave it behind
Hearing your silence, it screams our goodbye
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye
Let us go to waste

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain
In the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace
Till the end of all his days
From the ashes of hate
It's a cruel demon's fate
On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay
There will be no escape
'Cause he's fallen far from grace

Your chains have been broken
You've suffered so long
You will never change

I can't sleep 'cause it's burning deep inside
Like gasoline on a fire running wild
No more fear 'cause I'm getting closer now
So unreal but I like it anyhow

I go faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster

I've been walking this road of desire
I've been begging for blood on the wall
I don't care if I'm playing with fire
I'm aware that I'm frozen inside
I have known all along
So much more going on, no denying
But I know I'm not standing alone
You've been playing my mind through my wishes
You can feel that we're haunting the truth
Don't know, I can't hold on, always losing control

In the middle of the night
I don't understand what's going on, it's a world gone astray
In the middle of the night, I can't let it out
Someone keeps searching and shatters your life
It will never be afraid
In the middle of the night

No more tears, no, 'cause nothing else matters
I've been closing my eyes for too long
Only vengeance will make me feel better

Within Temptation - Iron


Left in the darkness, here on your own
Woke up a memory, feeding the pain
You cannot deny it, there's nothing to say
It's all that you need to find the way

Oh damn, the war is coming
Oh damn, you feel you want it
Oh damn, just bring it on today

You can't live without the fire
It's the heat that makes you strong
'Cause you're born to live
And fight it all the way
You can't hide what lies inside you
It's the only thing you know
You're embracing that, never walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away

Raised in this madness, you're on your own
It made you fearless, nothing to lose
Dreams are a drug here, they get in your way
That's what you need to fight day by day

Don't walk away

You need not to fear us
Unless you're a dark heart
A vile one, who preys on the innocent
I promise
You can't hide forever even into the darkness
For we'll hunt you down like the animals you are
And pull you into the very bowels of hell

Oh damn, the war is coming
Oh damn, you feel you want it
Oh damn, just bring it on today
You can't live without the fire

Within Temptation - Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)


I've been dreaming for so long
To find a meaning to understand
The secret of life
Why am I here to try again?
Will I always, will you always
See the truth when it stares you in the face?
Will I ever, will I never free myself
By breaking these chains?

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back, it's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
And then at last I'll be on my way

I've been living for so long
Many seasons passed me by
I've seen kingdoms through ages
Rise and fall, I've seen it all
You might also likeI've seen the horror, I've seen the wonders
Happening just in front of my eyes
Will I ever, will I never free myself
By making it right?

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back, it's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
And then at last I'll be on my way

Jillian, our dream ended long ago
All our stories and all our glory I held so dear
We won't be together
For ever and ever, no more tears
I'll always be here until the end

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back, it's my fault
Your destiny is forlorn
Have to live till it's undone
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul
I'd turn it back
And then at last I'll be on my way

Birds and butterflies
Rivers and mountains she creates
But you'll never know

Cannot control her

Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
She goes her way

With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through
On her way

Believing that their soul lives on
Until the end of time
I'll carry them with me

Within Temptation - Paradise (What About Us?)


There's no sense, the fire burns
When wisdom fails, it changes all
The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning
Blood red skies, I feel so cold
No innocence, we play our roll
The wheel embodies all, where are we going?

All in all, you'd expect the wise to be wiser, fallen from grace and
All and all I guess we should've known better 'cause

What about us? Isn't it enough?
No, we're not in paradise
This is who we are, this is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise
But it's all we want, and it's all that we're fighting for
Though it's not paradise

You and us, or I and them
There comes a time to take a stand
The wheel is watching all, it keeps on burning
The venom works, it's like a curse
A Trojan horse, when will we learn?
The wheel embodies all that keeps returning

Within Temptation - The Reckoning


As cold as stone, they march in darkness
Enslaving the young and killing their fathers
But soon they'll know the path they've chosen
Has carved their faith in stone

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

Red tears run down like a river
Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
No fear you wanna end the pain
Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning
(Bring the reckoning)

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

We're all alone, walking in twilight
The night has been long, and so many have fallen
Feel no remorse, light will be breaking
Our freedom is worth it all

Between the madness and the sadness and the fire burning
The end of war, the great divine
We'll see the day of reckoning

I've gotta try it's not over yet
No signals of life have you left
My heart is bleeding just for you
Bleeds for only you
And it hurts to know the truth
Are you looking for savior
Chasing a dream
Love turned to hate
Now I'm crossing the border
Sealing our fate
But I'm not afraid

Oh Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you you will like it, I know
Oh Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh Sinéad, come break away with me
This second chance I know won't last
But it's OK, got no regrets
And I, I feel the end near, I'm no fool
Getting closer
But I'm doing what I should

When you stay low nothing happens
Does it feel right?
Late at night
Things I thought I put behind me
Haunt my mind

I just know there's no escape now
Once it set its eyes on you
But I won't run
Have to stare it in the eye

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I've gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground

Getting stronger, coming closer
Into my world

That it's time for me to face it
Can I take it?

Nocny Kochanek - Dziewczyna z kebabem

1 ContributorDziewczyna z kebabem Lyrics
Dwanaście złotych może zabić miłość w człowieku
Stoisz samotna przy małej budce koło dworca PKS-u
Na zewnątrz zimno, a w środku ciepło dzieli cię lada i brudne okienko
Turek wbija tasak - to jest nasz kat, z baraniny robi danie
Przez żołądek do serca nie trafisz do mnie - przez żołądek po rozstanie
Pytasz czy czuje dreszcz i bicie serca twego
Ja nie czuje nic, tylko z ust twych odór sosu czosnkowego

Dziewczyno z kebabem, proszę nie otwieraj ust
Dziewczyno z kebabem, sosy kapią ci na biust
Dziewczyno z kebabem, tasak wbijasz w serce mi
Dziewczyno z kebabem, wyjdź stąd ! Tam są drzwi

Dwie noce nie spałem, nie to, że tęskniłem
Całe dwie noce mieszkanie wietrzyłem
Podwójne mięso, sos dobrze wymieszany
Kebab parzył cię w dłonie, byłem w tobie zakochany
Wciąż widzę cie jak kroczysz ulicami
Z cebulą między twoimi zębami
Na policzku keczup, włosy w baraninie
To już koniec opowieści o kebabowej dziewczynie
Pytasz czy czuje dreszcz i bicie serca twego
Ja nie czuje nic, tylko z ust twych odór sosu czosnkowego

Nocny Kochanek - Koń Na Białym Rycerzu


Samotna w wieży zamknięta
Z głodu przestała już jeść
Między udami, gdzie kiedyś wiatr hulał
Rozciąga się pajęcza sieć
Minęło dokładnie lat pięćdziesiąt parę
A może nawet i mniej
I choć się niewielu starało
To żaden nie uwolnił jej
Wierzy głęboko, że zobaczy w wieży
Tego, o którym wciąż śni
Wie, że się rzuci na niego jak zwierzę
Gdy ten przerwie pajęczą nić
Dziwne stękanie się nagle rozlega
Czyżby to ktoś wspinał się?
Przez okno księżniczka dostrzega
Konia co rży, czy tam rżnie

To był koń na białym rycerzu
Na białym rycerzu był koń

Nocny Kochanek - Minerał Fiutta

Skuter w dieslu bez przeglądu, silnik 1.3
Pod kurek zalany olejem rzepakowym
Za sterami na siodełku bez litery A
W prawo jazdy wbitej i wypity
Nie muszę chyba dodawać, że nie ma ubezpieczenia
Ale to oczywiste i nie mówię tu o AC
Światło stopu ciągle świeci się, a linkę gazu
Zębami szarpie, bo w chuj mu się spieszy
Z piramidy król podbił galaktykę Kurwix
Rdestem obsiał cały świat
Jedyna nadzieja na Khutasie jest
Nawet nie wiadomo czy minerał tam jest
Dalej dalej po minerał Fiutta
To przygody czas (to przygody czas)
Dalej dalej. Minerał Fiutta

Nocny Kochanek - Pigułka Samogwałtu

1 ContributorPigułka Samogwałtu Lyrics
Światła neony, w kieszonce kondomy
Jestem na disco lekko zrobiony
Pierwszy raz w klubie i wszystko wiruje
Jak rekin w zatoce, tak tutaj się czuje
W ławicy dupeczek, ta jedna jedyna
Wiem, że na mój kawior już leci jej ślina
Więc puszczam jej oczko, a w zamian dostaje
Jej palec środkowy, aż się zajarałem
Z glazury parkietu już sypią się wióry
Choć trochę gorąco w tych spodniach ze skóry
Idziemy do baru, łyknęła przynętę
Do piątki ja stawiam, bo dziś będzie dęte
Nie może wytrzymać, przysuwa się do mnie
Na pewno ją jaram powiem nieskromnie
Podaje mi piwo, do ust je przystawia
Mówi ,,kobietom się nie odmawia"

Coraz szybciej wiruje świat
Jak kolumna Zygmunta stanął mi ptak
Toną po uszy w gaciach me ręce
I sam nie wiem kiedy ląduje w łazience
Teraz już wiem co zrobiłaś kochana
Pigułka do piwa została dodana
Na sobie sam dokonałem nokautu
Autoerotyzm, Pigułka samogwałtu

Lecz ja nie wymiękam, mam jaja ze stali
Za ręce i nogi wynoszą nad ranem
Wiedziałem, że dzisiaj będzie rypane
Choć z dziewczyną z klubu nie wyszło mi może
To z ręką w łazience nie było najgorzej

Coraz szybciej wiruje świat
Jak kolumna Zygmunta stanął mi ptak
Idę przed siebie, sam nie wiem gdzie
A zboczona siła prowadzi mnie
Teraz już wiem co zrobiłaś kochana

Arch Enemy - Avalanche


A fistful of fear in my hands
A bullet of betrayal in my brain
No progress comes from pleasure
We smile in ignorance and learn in pain
Willful deceit was your plan
Desperately avoid the blame
Who will you answer to now?
Sharpened your shovels just to dig your grave

Stand up 'cause the ground is in your way
I won't give you any peace
Yet still, you talk
Try to fight, but I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Sick, sick, sick
I'm sick of being your martyr
Your inflated ego is just dead weight
Bask in all the eyes upon you
Before you know it they'll have turned away

You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Wait and see, cry yourself a lonesome creek
Your decaying corpse can feed the roots of my towering tree
Just wait and see
You're dead to me

Yet still, you speak
Trying to justify what you're doing to me
I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you, what did you expect?

Pantera - Domination


(First take like a motherfucker)

Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you, then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget when there's nothing else left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination
Yeah

A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail marks demise of your life
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick?
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end
Forcing you to bend

And the writing on the wall

And to yourself you will befall

Pantera - This Love


If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love

Aephanemer - Le Radeau de La Méduse


Ahead of her fellow ships
The Medusa strayed from its path
First secession in a long series
With a dire aftermath
Stranded far from shore
The castaways escaped on crafts
Some carried by running oars
Others on a hastily built raft

Like the waves of the sea beaten by the winds
Crashing in their course above the abyss
They'd be tormented in a thousand ways between
The boards and the sails of the infamous machine
Among the woеs that struck them
And were worthy to rеlate
Was to remember those men
Who'd put them there and sealed their fate

The raft is hauled by the small fleet
Helpless and exposed to deceit
They dropped the ropes at the first fright
Breaking the bond that kept them tied

Maudits par leur nom leurs visages changés en pierre
Comme si la gorgone avait paru devant eux
L'hostilité primitive sur eux se resserre
Sous les plus sinistres cieux

Twice doomed by mankind, exiled on the seas
These branded soldiers were just out of their cells
Caught up by the spite of relentless furies
Once more prisoners of hell

Thirst had soon devoured them
Redoubled by the sun's rays
Legs and feet were skinned
Salt water eating them away
The counting of the drowned
Taken by despair and storms
Paced the days spent on this narrow and precarious floor
Hunger had them slice the dead flesh of a former friend
Feeding with dismay on this omen of their coming end
Thrown into the sea, the wounded gave a tragic sight
Yet all this was none compared to the violence unleashed at night

One by one nocturnal madness made them slaves
Echoes of the fury of the waves
Primeval fear filled them with sedition's breath
Rising toward them from the ocean depths
Like the waves of the sea beaten by the winds
Crashing in their course above the abyss
Out of a hundred remained only fifteen
Saved from the ordeal of the infamous machine
Although the woes struck again
These living wrecks back on the earth
Remember those other men
Who rescued them, restored their worth

Aephanemer - Antigone


Behold crossing through the city gates
Beyond walls too narrow for her fate
Comes Antigone, as told by
These old rhymes
A brother that they chose to disregard
And nothing more than an offended heart
She doesn't fear to defy
Decrees nor crimes

No mourning for this deceased
Soon the prey of ravenous beasts
Excruciating sight of flesh
Mundane frailty is all that is left

An echo of these noble lines
One more timе

Honor this mortal corpse
A veil of dust on the dеad one
Hades wants equal laws
Two of us whom Death has won
Summon the inner voice
The city of stone and order
Love is the daemon's choice
Undergoes a tremor
You might also like
Defiance worthy of praise
Sent her alive to the grave

An ideal of fortitude
The one who never bends
Feeds its heart of solitude
Is either way condemned
Such are the radical deeds
And their tragic outcomes
Ethical beacons we need
At the forefront

A glimpse of the light that still shines
Across time

Honor this mortal corpse
A veil of dust on the dead one
Hades wants equal laws
Two of us whom Death has won
Summon the inner voice
The city of stone and order
Love is the daemon's choice
Undergoes a tremor
We don't know that we're blind
Nor the harm that we inflict
Without great figures by our side
To guide us on this journey

Aephanemer - Bloodline

Spawn of Earth, heir to the bane
What is worth such suffering and pain?
Land is flayed under foolish dominion
Untold slaves consigned to oblivion
They're despised while plunged in despair
Hubris claims each day a growing share
Do you feel cut off from this world?
When you weep for countless dying herds
First do no harm
Never be ashamed of having a kind heart
Then rise to height
Take a view from above where the prospect is bright
From the sea of cosmic time and space
All the boundaries wane and the differences fade
A unit within an army
One vessel among many
Walls were built to justify the wrong
But distinction is about to decline
We're kin of all whose fate is to evolve
The last offsprings of a single bloodline
Can you feel this breeze of anarchy?
While the madness spreads just as the blood runs
The uprising of a new humanity
Breaking old rules and binding new ones
You might also likeSink back down
Cleverness is a gift we're wearing like a crown
Now play your part
Remember adapting is the purpose of being smart
Nothing seems to improve through our tiny lifespan
But history is on move, the quickening began
Behaviours go viral within the web of lives
Some people strive towards better times
Walls were built to justify the wrong
But distinction is about to decline
We're kin of all whose fate is to evolve
The last offsprings of a single bloodline
If the ruin do fall upon us all
Still remains the choice of our deeds right in the here and now
Walls were built to exploit overmuch
But extinction is at the end of the line
Our misdeeds might backfire on us
For the living is deeply intertwined
Can't you feel this need for empathy?
While the madness threatens to take it all
If we lay down our old burden of vanity
We'll regain our place in the whole

Bleed From Within - Overthrone

I feel your nails still dragging under my skin
Digging holes in the walls of disclosure
Let the wolves tear themselves apart
And set the boundary in range of salvation
Survive this confliction
You'll lie in the grave that you dug for us
Just take the throne away and seal their fate
And now we're singing
"Throw them to the lions, Hell awaits"
And after all this time, wipe clean the slate
Sing it again
"Throw them to the lions, Hell awaits"
In darkness, we must illuminate
Find solace if we're surviving this
Under the waves of indifference
We set the boundary in range of salvation
Survive this confliction
You'll lie in the grave that you dug for us
It's time to turn it up, set the pace, final chance to break the chain
Looking down on our leaders in disgrace
The stage is set for fame, the gimmick worn away
Face up to the overthrone

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open

Beat me black and blue

Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

Bleed From Within - Levitate


I wrap my head around this
To know that you exist
Delicate mind limits the time that we have
We levitate to find bliss
Outside of this abyss
Delicate mind limits the time that we have left

I am out of sight, out of mind
Open up, I'll crawl inside
Lay my anchor down, the second vessel in this ground
Confusion surrounds
Another swing of the hammer, but still the mirror reflects
It's the sickness inside you, open your eyes
What you see is what you despise

I wrap my head around this
To know that you exist
Vanishing mind limits the timе that we have
We lеvitate to find bliss
Outside of this abyss
Delicate mind limits the time that we have left
You might also like
Follow the past into the eye of the present
Reclaim your independence
You are released from the prison that holds you now
But not forever
Levitate
To defy this affliction that grips your fate
(Defy this affliction)
(Resuscitate)

I wrap my head around this
To know that you exist
Vanishing mind limits the time that we have
We levitate to find bliss
Outside of this abyss
Delicate mind limits the time that we have left
I'll search for you in the guts of the lost world

The mind fades in a growing mist
This affliction we can't reverse
Now in my head I'm screaming
Levitate
I wrap my head around this
To know that you exist
We levitate to find bliss
Outside of this abyss
Delicate mind limits the time that we have left
That we have left
(Vanishing mind limits the time that we have)

Turisas - Rasputin

"Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey"
"Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey"
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the tsar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
But when he's drinking and lusting
And hungers of power become known to more and more people
Their demands to do something about this outrageous man
Grew louder and louder
"Hey hey"
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
Waaouyeah
Oh those Russians

Týr - Hel Hath No Fury

Some things we cannot mend
And good times always come to an end
Here at the dawn of a day a painful path
Unfolds before my eyes
So if you will, mortal men, remain
Fly me away, chooser of the slain
Above the blood drenched fields
Of furious battle high the fairest flies
I pulled her arrow from out my heart
We wandered already worlds apart
And I have seen the heavens hold no rage
Like love to hatred turned
The gods may grant me a brighter day
There's more where that came from anyway
Life holds no promises nor Hel a fury
Like a woman scorned
Faith was the star that fell
It may forebode our last farewell
Still others shine their height
And hopeful light on distant shores at dawn
Our days are all but a ghost of grey
And I am already far away
For I have walked alone in shadow
Since my goddess has withdrawn
You might also likeI pulled her arrow from out my heart

Life holds no promises nor Hel a fury

Wintersun - Sons of Winter and Stars


Behold the rain of stars – The awakening of darkened skies
Falling from the dark – The symphony of dying lights
Behold the rain of stars – The blazing fire came pouring down
Falling from the dark – And life and death became unbound
Sons of winter and stars Rise!
Sons of winter and stars Rise!
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
Fly with us through the darkness
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
And we shall embrace the stars
And we shall open the doors of time

I have awakened the darkness
Taste the fear! Taste the pain!
I am the one who seeks vengeance
Into the darkness we fly
Into the shadows they hide
Into the darkness we fly
They will never survive, they’ll die
Oh they will die!
You might also likeI sacrifice everything, just for one moment
I throw away everything that matters to me the most
I’m flying through the darkness
The fire casts a shadow on me
I tear a part of my heart for creation of dimensions
And we fly beyond the restless shadows
We fly beyond the stars
We fly beyond the birth of the worlds
So old I’ve become – Thousand years staring into emptiness
But now I realize – That it was just an illusion
All this time I thought it was you that would save the sun
Oh rain comes and washes the hate away
Now I am at the crossroads with questions
Somewhere, someday I will find what I am here for
Who am I

I’m wondering now where will you take me
From the horizon the light comes alive
Into the mountains high we set our way
Will we find our way in this long winter night
I see the land of fading sun and rising mountains
And I finally feel that I’ve found my home
But oh, how it feels so cold when my dreams wither in fragments of time
Revealing that this land will die
Before the winds so cold
The world was shattered in the fragments of time
Before the autumn rains
The coldness will again awake
Falling snow, so soft and cold
Dying moon cast down so weak
Frozen lake, the dancing spirits
Calling me to join in the cosmic dream
The silence is tempting me now...
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars
We’ve come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we’re gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun 
Until we fade away – Fate will find it’s way
Until we drift into the dark
It’s not too late to find a way – Fate will find it’s way
And fly in cold embrace of stars
Mysteries of time
Unfolding in cosmic dreams
Leaving life and death meaningless
Before the revelation of infinity
Embrace the stars!
The energy flows in me like a river of stars
I’m surrounded by the circle of fire, but eternal ice has frozen my heart
I’m lost in the pathways of time
But now the time has come for us!
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars
We’ve come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we’re gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun 
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars!

League of Distortion - Wolf or Lamb


(Are you a wolf?
Are you a wolf?)

Let me tell you 'bout an ancient tale
Countless years ago and far away
On the meadow where the sheep would graze
Doom was to take place

Seized with panic they would flinch and run
Never knowing what they could have done
Without fighting they would lose their breath
Leaping into death

Would you do the same?

Are you a wolf, are you a lamb?
Do you surrender or withstand?
Are you the hunter or the prey?
Are you a wolf or a lamb?

(Are you a wolf?

You might also like
All this happened at the dead of night
Cunning wolves were ready for the fight
Never resting, gathered on the trail
Waiting for the bale

Desperate howls 'cause they stood no chance
Armed with courage as their best defense
All or none, there was no turning back
Willing to attack

Would you do the same?

Are you a wolf, are you a lamb?
Do you surrender or withstand?
Are you the hunter or the prey?
Are you a wolf or a lamb?
Are you a wolf, are you a lamb?
Do you take orders or command?
Are you an enemy or friend?
Are you a wolf or a lamb?

There are many ways to live and die
Those who run from death collapse in life
Every story must come to an end
Tell me, are you a wolf or a lamb?
Would you do the same? (do the same)

Are you a wolf, are you a lamb?
Do you surrender or withstand?
Are you the hunter or the prey?
Are you a wolf or a lamb?

There are many ways to live and die

When the last living seed was saved, I thought it would bring a new focus
I thought it would end the infinite bitterness caused by egotism

Latched to this life like a death-grip we're satisfied
With the mundane and keeping out of sight
But still we are young
We are young
I'll stare them angels down
Keep them in the back room, shut the door and let go
Now we stare at the grave cold and paralyzed
Pushing daisies while we still feel the sunshine
We are young
We are young
Slip through the marigolds and please our damaged souls

This place is holding me
Jump through the rope, let's make it credible
When blood is all we see
Life is impossible

Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spine to work it out

You're just another one wandering aimlessly until the grave
The signs of the times are upon us all
We're bleeding for tomorrow
Sucking on the mother's dead tit of sorrow, sorrow
It's alright, we'll learn it all before we go
Snapped by the neck as we follow
Chin up, now tighten the rope
Leave it all hollow

No funeral, no pyre left burning
This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spine to work it out

(If I were the devil, I would promote an attitude of loving things and using people, instead of the other way around
I would make it legal to take the life of the unborn
Make it socially acceptable to take one's own life, and invent machines to make it more convenient
I would attack the family, the backbone of every nation
I would come up with drugs that sedate the mind and target the young, and I would get sports heroes to advertise them)
I guess I will just leave things the way they are

This place is holding me (This place is holding me)
Jump through the rope, let's make it credible (Credible)
When blood is all we see, life is impossible
(Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spine to work it out)
Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spine to work it out
No funeral, no pyre left burning
This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spine to work it out

Finntroll - Under bergets rot

Vid morgonstund jag skådade på bergets rygg
En fåra röd som hjärteblod
Djupt jag såg den falla
In i dunklet av bergets rot
Vid solnedgång jag skådade på bergets rygg
Nu som lågor de dansa
I sommarnatten, barnen av hällens stam
In mot dunklet av bergets rot
Modigt jag klängde vid fårans gap
Snart sänktes jag mot mörkrets sköte
Fornfäders sång i djupet lät
I minnet fann jag då
En sång jag aldrig sjungit förr
Från mina läppar, från mina bringa den eka
Den sång jag aldrig sjungit förr
Vid morgonstund jag skådade i grottans valv
En skymt av vinterns vita ljus
Då steg jag med hast
Ur dunklet av bergets rot
Vid solnedgång jag skådade på marken kall
Snöns och isens täcke
Då blott en stund jag sjungit
Med folket av bergets rotYou might also like

Kolejny dzień, kolejna walka
Mimo tylu stoczonych ta i tak nie będzie łatwa
Dróg do poznania jest naprawdę wiele
Ode mnie zależy która stanie się moim celem

Zobacz jak biegnę wciąż przed siebie
Jednym tchem nie patrząc wstecz (Nie patrzę wstecz)
Jestem ogniem i płomieniem
Zobacz jak unoszę się ponad wszystko to, co rani mnie (Rani mnie)
Jestem siłą, która rośnie z każdym dniem

Nie przygaszą mnie puste słowa
Chcę zacząć budować mój świat od nowa
Każda porażka uczy nabierać wiatru w skrzydła
By po upadku znów móc wstać i wygrać

Zobacz jak biegnę wciąż przed siebie
Jednym tchem nie patrząc wstecz (Nie patrzę wstecz)
Jestem ogniem i płomieniem
Zobacz jak unoszę się ponad wszystko to, co rani mnie (Rani mnie)
Jestem siłą, która rośnie z każdym dniem

Everything was ready for the war
White linen sails, the laughter on the deck
The black doves aboard
Dressed up as pirates women took their places
They were young and they were beautiful
Daggers and garters, cannon of pure grace
Prepare! Seize arms!
Get ready, they're coming!
Sea!
Give us your strength, lead the way
Moon!
Give us your light, show us the way
Wind!
Give us hope when the time comes
Home!
Give us the reason to fight
We're fighters, we're reckless
Hey ho!
We're all so fearless
We're after fame and gloria
We're drinking, we're tempting
Hey ho!
We're singing
We are enchanting warriors!

The banner of black doves is feared across the seas
Women so graceful, silk and armony
Eyes on the horizon, minds of the coming fight
Again they shall prevail
The line of rifles and scent of powder
Ruthless and wild that's the way they are
Sweet victory it is their only aim
Again! Seize arms!
Get ready, they're coming
Sea!
Give us your strength, lead the way

1 ContributorSpirit of Forgetfulness Lyrics
The thought of you possesses me
You're the dweller of my mind
Where you are utterly and vividly alive

I called upon Lethe
The spirit of forgetfulness
I implored her deeply
To erase my memory
She said "Be careful what you wish for, deary"

"Those waters aren't meant for the living
For all you know, I could be a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
I might not be your well-wisher"

Lethe dеcided to help me
Thе spirit of oblivion
She took me to the underworld
Among the souls of the dead
Where I drank from the river
To help me forget

I've got no remembrance of who I am
Oh, I forgot it all
Yet I still remember you
I've got no remembrance of who I am
Yet I still know you through and through

Those waters aren't meant for the living
I made a desperate deal with a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
A misleading voice, with a truthful whisper
Those waters aren't meant for the living
I made a desperate deal with a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
A misleading voice, with a truthful whisper
Misleading voice, with a truthful whisper

If this is really living
Then why am I so unforgiving

To explain that today

Alestorm - Zombies Ate My Pirate Ship


In the dead of night
We hear the sound of thunder
Undead fiends arise
To terrorize and plunder
Crawling through the sea
A dendrophagic horde
Our ship's no longer safe
The zombies have just climbed aboard

Bloodlust in their eyes
Our boat is their prize
A feast for the dead
Devouring the ship and inside of our heads

Far across the sea
Zombies wait for me
Craving brains and treasure
It's their destiny
Til my dying day
Hear these words I say
Zombies ate my pirate ship

Centuries ago
The prophecy was written
So the story goes
The grimmest and the true frostbitten
Druids made a pact
That zombie hordes would roam
In search of stolen wood
The forest shall reclaim its own

They've eaten the mast
Save the crow's nest 'til last
Sink down to the depths
Cursing their name with our final breath
Die!
Fuck you, zombie scum!

Zombies wait for me
Craving brains and treasure

Six feet below the ground again
Here lies what we might have been
Crawling underneath my skin, it's eating me alive
You stay as silent as the grave
Why I slowly rot away
Feels like I'm gonna suffocate, under all the lies

These secrets you're keeping
Like a casket hiding all your demons
Covered in dirt in dust, it's gonna be the death of us
I can't see em, but I feel em
Like a ghost no one can hear me screamin
I'm so over your secrets

Dirt underneath my fingernails, clawing out from the betrayal
Dying in this living hell, you buried me alive
Your cloak and dagger can only get you so far
You think you're hiding but I see shadows in the dark
You've got the shovel but I know where the bodies are
Where the bodies are

These secrets you're keeping
Like a casket hiding all your demons
Covered in dirt in dust, it's gonna be the death of us

Here's to a life of roaming around
Where there's a feast we can be found
Travelling far, over sea, over land
For glory and fame and a drink in our hand
There's no dread in our hearts, no remorse in our soul
Pillage the world for silver and gold
It's the path we have chosen, the creed of our kind
Standing together, leave no one behind

Hail the dead and the goat that gives us mead
On the roof she's gnawing Lärad's leaves
Fills the vat with a drink that is so sweet
Worthy of fame
Heidrun is her name

This life it is not for everyone
The grind of travel can wear you down
Our grave may be waiting around the bend
But we'll keep fighting to whatever end
And when we are done roaming around
There is a feast where we will be found
To Valhalla! With hearts full of pride
A drink in our hand and a girl on our side

On the roof top gnawing Lärad's leaves
Fills the vat with a drink that's oh so sweet

Over the ocean and over land
After all the tours
We have earned our seats in Oden's glorious hall
Here we sit at the feast
A cold drink in our horns
Heidrun's the one that gives the mead to the battle worn
She stands on Valhalla's roof
Filling the vat with the sweetest mead
She is one and the same

Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There, burning into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go ‘round

And these are the hands we're given
Use them, and let's start trying

That we know we'll never keep
Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?

Now, this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them, and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to

Halestorm - Heart of Novocaine


You made me tough, you made me numb
You are the maker of what I've become
And now I am strong where I was weak
And I am unafraid of being me
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine

Once upon a time you had control
And lorded over my poor soul
And I trusted you but now I see
You never knew the real me
And now I'm angry and you wonder why
You see the fire burning in my eyes
Once you had me but you lost me now
And there's no going back
So say hello to the monster that you made

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Thank you for the stain that you left on my brain
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine

My fear has died, my tears have dried
I don't feel afraid and I won't run away
I believe in me and now I see
Right through your lies, hiding behind your eyes
Because of you I'll make it through
And nothing can hurt me like you did, anymore

Thank you for the pain, thank you for the hate
Thank you for the way that you left me scarred
Now there's nothing you can say to wash it all away
Now because of you I've got a heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine
A heart of Novocaine

Three Days Grace - Time of Dying


On the ground I lay, motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep?
Is this all a dream?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die  (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

On this bed I lay, losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much?
Or just not enough?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

Bullet for My Valentine - Leap of Faith


Too many cuts and too many broken bones
Draining the life, burying skeletons
Do or die, is this the feeling I'm craving?
Waiting for life to ignite
Is this the moment for taking?
A leap of faith, I'll...

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

The beat of a pulse, feeling it resonate
Into the night, hearing it fade away
Do or die, this is choice that I’m making
Feels like I’m living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith I’ll...

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can’t break me

Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me

Not dead or alive
No feeling to find
Like I've been hypnotised
How do I see
A light in the dark
When nothing is real
And I don't hear a heart
I can't wake up from this cold dark state
Of hopelessness, so numb to everything

It's under my skin
Living within
I'm chained to my mind
So undignified
Run from the tide
That's rising so high
Come wash me away
'Cause I've no will to fight

Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything

Each horizon is a new beginning
Rise and reign
Far from the Fjords and the ice cold currents
Ravens soar over new frontiers
Songs and sagas of a fate determined
Shields and spears
Vows of favour or the thrill of plunder
Pull together for the clan and kin
Clank of hammers and the crash of thunder
Pound within

Powerwolf - Wolfborn


From the land of seven hills
Came the might of the fateful twins
In the blood of the will to kill
Remember the wolfborn
Fire born and to face the fears
By the blade of the swords and spears
To the quest of a thousand years
Remember the wolfborn

From the heart of Rome
To the land of the war and hate
First came The Lord, the rebel then the fire
To the sacred dome and the hand of our God and fate
Last came the sword, the weapon, then desire

At night we all pray
That the dark will never end
At day we are forced to hide
In silent graves
Rex lupum dominae

And then the creature
For the fame alone we are sworn
To the iron seal

And the preacher

At night fold your hands
To the force in Heaven high
At day we are bound to lie in darkest caves

I never claimed to be something more than me
Your standards, I refuse to see
I will answer only to myself
So why don't you police someone else?

The place I call home isn't there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit
Let this be the end of it

Once you held a place for me
But now that I've left you went and gave up my seat
Don't expect me to share your visions of life
I'll take my chances somewhere else

The place I call home isn't there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit

Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice

The dawn of century, a boy born by a lake
Resettled from Karelia’s plains
Grown to a man in exile as the great war came
Unleashed a shadow on his world

Oh, no
Oh, no
Who knows his name?

Inmate in hell or a hero imprisoned?
Soldier in Auschwitz, who knows his name?
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz, who hides behind 4859?

Outside help never came, decided to break free
The end of April '43
Join the uprising, fight on the streets while hiding his rank
Takes command all while serving his country in need

Oh, no
Oh, no

Paramore - Misery Business


Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep

Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

Queen - We Are the Champions


I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few

I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through (And I mean to go on and on, and on, and on)
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise

Dobrze wiem, że ja czasem pachnę lipą
Środkowa półka, która nie chce być elitą

Dupa jak basetla i przekrwiony wzrok
Jak lekarskie piłki obok piersi pierś
Nogi jak sarenka – taka na nich sierść
Wąsy jak Sobieski i czosnkowy dech

Хищник крадётся, готовый сокрушить врагов

Бисмарк идёт под громкий гул машин!
Он повелитель бурь
Он создан, чтоб возглавить Кригсмарин!
Король семи морей
Бисмарк возглавил Кригсмарин!
Он повелитель бурь
Он создан,  Кригсмарин!
Король семи морей
Возглавил Кригсмарин!
Он повелитель бурь
Он создан,  Кригсмарин!
Король морей
Бисмарк возглавил Кригсмарин!

На мой последний вздох
Ко мне явился бог
И он мне сказал
Стыдно кем ты стал

И дьявол вслед за ним
Рассеяв едкий дым
Мне мораль прочел
Что он не причем

Я запутан, где правда и ложь?
Что посеешь, то в итоге и пожнешь
Я один, я стою у врат
С обратной стороны рая, называемой ад
С обратной стороны рая, называемой, называемой ад

Сегодня бог сказал
Мне стыдно кем ты стал
Мой заблудший сын
Я согласен с ним

И дьявол маску сняв
Свое лицо подняв
Он выглядел как я
И я отвел лишь взгляд

Я погружаюсь, я опускаюсь, не жалея ни о чем

Ко мне всё ближе с каждым днём

Ко мне всё ближе с каждым днём

1 ContributorThe Last Stand Lyrics

Рим окутан страшным злом
В 1527-м
Зло пробралось в сердце Ватикана
Армия имперских псов
Что сорвалась со своих оков
Свергнув лордов и решив наполнить карманы

20 тысяч стальных мечей
То предатели веры
Шли к собору Петра на рейд
Где гвардейцы держали двери
Ровно - 189 воинов Христа!

С верой в сердце, молитвой в устах
У святого порога
Отдав жизни во имя Христа
Прикоснувшись к богу
С верой в сердце, молитвой в устах
В руки взяв алебарды
Отдав жизни во имя Христа
И слагают барды о них

20 тысяч стальных мечей
То предатели веры

Пали у порога собора
Преданные церкви, свет их не меркнет
Папа не был свергнут, и враг повергнут
Воины престола, сыны христовы
Пали у порога собора
Пред вратами в рай
С верой в сердце, молитвой в устах
У святого порога
Отдав жизни во имя Христа
Прикоснувшись к богу
С верой в сердце, молитвой в устах

Когда над пустошами вновь взойдет луна
Когда угаснет в небе яркий свет
Мы пробуждаемся по зову ордена...
Укрываясь во тьме
Сложив в молитве руки, в чтении Библии
Смирившись с участью, что нам дана
Мы воины Каина, вкусив жертвы свои
Испиваем до дна!

Мы выпьем кровь! Пробужденье празднуя
Мы выпьем кровь! Под алеющий закат
Мы выпьем кровь! Смерти не подвластные
Мы выпьем кровь! И отправимся в ад!

О, всемогущий, мы лишь демоны пустынь
Святые мученики смутных дней
Учуяв жертву мы выходим из святынь
И несёмся за ней!
Мы лики тьмы, мы повелители ночи
Воспряв от сна, нас манит сладкий зов
Когда кровавый небосвод пронзят лучи
Ты уже будешь мертв!

Агнцев отбившихся от стада своего
Прочь дневного света ускользая
Ожидая миг когда угаснет небосвод

На волнах Камчатских вод
Встал на рейд Английский Флот
Принеся в лучах Луны
Едкий смог Крымской войны
Сопки русских батарей
Ждут владычицу морей
Жгёт костры казачья рать
Мы одни, но нас не взять

Их 926, но с ними доблесть и честь
Ветра вулканов разнесут благую весть

Там, в глухой дали, где-то на краю земли
Тянет вглубь камчатских прерий
Дым войны четырёх империй
Средь холодных вод, принял бой далёкий порт
Враг разгромлен и ввергнут в хаос!
Это Петропавловск

Где-то вдалеке Дунай
Император Николай
Не стерпев султанский нрав
Держит натиск трёх держав
А восточней в тыщах верст
Одинокий русский пост
У Авачинской губы
Взял бразды своей судьбы

Bo Burnham - Welcome to the Internet


Welcome to the internet! Have a look around
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found
We've got mountains of content, some better, some worse
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first

Welcome to the internet! Come and take a seat
Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?
There's no need to panic; this isn't a test, haha
Just nod or shake your head, and we'll do the rest

Welcome to thе internet! What would you prefеr?
Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?
Be happy! Be horny! Be bursting with rage!
We've got a million different ways to engage

Welcome to the internet! Put your cares aside
Here's a tip for straining pasta; here's a nine-year-old who died
We've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports
And a bunch of colored-pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other

Welcome to the internet! Hold on to your socks
'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock
They are grainy and off-putting; he just sent you more
Don't act surprised, you know you like it, you whore
You might also like
See a man beheaded, get offended, see a shrink
Show us pictures of your children, tell us every thought you think
Start a rumor, buy a broom, or send a death threat to a boomer
Or DM a girl and groom her, do a Zoom or find a tumor in your—
Here's a healthy breakfast option, you should kill your mom
Here's why women never fuck you; here's how you can build a bomb
Which Power Ranger are you? Take this quirky quiz
Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids

Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything, all of the time
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything, all of the time

You know, it wasn't always like this

Not very long ago, just before your time
Right before the towers fell, circa '99
This was catalogs, travel blogs, a chatroom or two
We set our sights and spent our nights waiting
For you!
You, insatiable you
Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two
And it did all the things we designed it to do
Now, look at you! Oh, ha, look at you!
You, you! Unstoppable, watchable
Your time is now; your inside's out; honey, how you grew
And if we stick together, who knows what we'll do?
It was always the plan to put the world in your hand
(*Laughs*)

Could I interest you in everything all of the time?

Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time?
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything and anything and everything
And anything and everything and
All of the time

Bo Burnham - Sad


This next song is a little bit longer than that one, and, uhm
It's about all the sad stuff I see in the world
And I see a lot of sad stuff, and it's called "Sad"
Get on my level, Madison
Picture a depressed onion cutting itself

*Crying*
I met a homeless man named Rich
He wasn't, isn't that terrible?
I saw a flyer for a lost dog and the dog didn't have any legs
I saw a diabetic kid trick or treating
I saw a giraffe who had a short neck
That was sad, or a deer
I saw an old man get hit by a train
He didn't see it in the pouring rain
He didn't hear me shout "Look out for the train!"
'Cause I didn't say anything

I just thought to myself, "Ooh this is gonna be sad"
And it was
I'm a genius

*Crying*
I saw a man with only one eye... In a 3D movie
I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mother's corpse
I saw a kitten stuck in a tree, then the kitten jumped off and he hung itself
I saw a boy who had red hair
I went to a store looking for something to buy
But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy
No, wait! This store sells mirrors
See what I did there?
Let's rock!
No...
You might also like
The world's so sad, Madison
Pain, war, genocide, racism, sexism
But I gotta remember there's good things about it too
Like the fact that none of that's happening to me! Score!
Still though, it's hard not to be sad about it
How do y'all do it?
I've been telling you terribly sad things this whole song, you haven't been sad at all
You've been happy. No, you’ve been laughing
That’s it, laughter, it’s the key to everything
It’s the way to solve all the sadness in the world
I mean, not for people that are actually sad, but for the people like us who’ve gotta fucking deal with ‘em all the time
Being a comedian isn’t being an insensitive prick capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public, it’s being a hero!
The world isn’t sad. The world’s funny! I get it now! I'm a sociopath!
I saw an old man slip and fall, what a fucking idiot
I saw a woman at her daughter’s funeral
Hahaha! Classic comedy!
Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now
The Holocaust and 9/11?
That shit’s funny 24/7
'Cause tragedy will be exclusively joked about
Because my empathy is bumming me out
Goodbye sadness
Hello jokes
Thank you very much

Bo Burnham - From God's Perspective


There's things I don't wanna be misconstrued in my act that I feel often are. I don't want you leaving my show thinking that I think I know better than people, or that I think that I'm better than people in general, um. Okay, I just, wanted to put that out there. Uh, this is a song from the perspective of God

The books you think I wrote are way too thick
Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn't be a dick?
And I don't watch you when you sleep
Surprisingly, I don't use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep

You're not going to heaven
Why the fuck would you think I'd ever kick it with you?
None of you are going to heaven
There's a trillion aliens cooler than you

You shouldn't abstain from rape just 'cause you think that I want you to
You shouldn't rape 'cause rape is a fucked up thing to do
Pretty obvious, just don't fucking rape people, please
Didn't think I had to write that one down for ya
I don't think masturbation is obscene
It's absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen
You make my job a living hell
I sent gays to fix overpopulation, and boy, did that go well

You're not going to heaven
Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns
None of you are going to heaven
You're not my children, you're a bad game of Sims
You might also like
You shouldn't abstain from pork just 'cause you think that I want you to
You can eat pork 'cause why the fuck would I give a shit?
I created the universe, think I'm drawing the line at the fuckin' deli aisle?
You argue and you bicker and you fight
Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night
Over what they think is true
But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you

You pray so badly for heaven
Knowing any day might be the day that you die
But maybe life on earth could be heaven
Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth a try?

My love's the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it
You won't need it
My love's the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it
You won't need it

I'm not gonna give you love just 'cause I know that you want me to
If you want love then the love has gotta come from you
Thank you very much

Mako - Bardzo Mała Żaba

Przychodzę do domu
A tam czeka na mnie
Dziwny nieproszony gość
Bardzo mała żaba
Je sobie kebaba
Przez telefon gada
Ej, ej, ej!
Żaba na kanapie
Muchy sobie łapie
Po pupie się drapie
Ej,ej,ej!
Żaba w moim domu
Mieszka po kryjomu
Nie powiem nikomu
Nie, nie, nie!
Żaba na balkonie
Żaba w mym salonie
Muszę jakoś przyzwyczaić się!
Dałbym jej na imię Krystyna
Ale nie wiem czy to chłopak czy dziewczyna
Od rana do nocy robaki wcina
I tańczy salsę jak istna maszyna
Nie wiem do końca, co mam z nią zrobić
Do kina ją zabierać, na spacery z nią chodzić?
Czy mam ją nauczyć korzystać z toalety?
Jak ona sika, jak faceci czy kobiety?
You might also likeŻaba jak każdy inny człowiek musi spać
Więc kładę ją do łóżka, jest bezpieczna, nie musi się bać

Mako (POL) - Siku Siku Mocz


Siedzę się na drzewie
I Nikt o tym nie wie
Zrywam Sobie liście
A wy sobie poszliście
A skoro już poszliście
To mogę spiewać sobie
O czym tylko chcę
Nawet i o tobie
Ale mi się nie chcę
Śpiewać o tobie
Ani nawet żadnej konkretnej osobie
Nie będę śpiewał
O księdzu z Sandomierza
Będę śpiewal o tym
Co wychodzi z pęcherza

Siku Siku Mocz
Siku Mocz
Siku Siku Mocz
Siku Siku MOCZ!

Nikt się nie naśmiewa
Sikam Sobie z drzewa
Kiedy jadę w góry
Sikam se na chmury
Kiedy wstaję z rana
Sikam na kolana
Tu radio kielce
Sikam ci w ręce
Gdy nie ma pieluchy
Sikają Maluchy
Przychodzi Lenka
Obsikana Ręka
Zjadłem dziś hot-doga
Obsikana Noga
Tеn Utwór jest kozacki
Sikam jak wąż strażacki

Kocham te piosenki
Sikam ci do ręki
To jеst teraz w modzie
Sikanie w samochodzie
Pęcherz opróżniony
Mokre kalesony
Nagle uderza
Zapalenie pęcherza
Muszę do lekarza
Muszę do lekarza
Jeśli się ożenię
Będę sikał do ołtarza
Jestem u Doktora
Niech pan sobie siada
Doktor mnie bada
A ja sikam do sąsiada
Mokre skarpety
Sikam z cezety
Fajne klozety
Ale sikam do gazety
Lubię kobiety
Więc sikam do Elżbiety
Nagrywam kasety
Jak sikam w krokiety
(MOCZ!)

Ah, I tell you where it's from (Africa)
That's from where Ebola comes (West Side)
It hides in the suitcase
Two days later it lands in the USA
I get it from my girlfriend and give it to my dad
I catch it on the subway and leave it in the cab
I eat it at Subway, drink it at Starbucks
Ebola's everywhere and I give no fucks

They scared, it's bad
Ebola's gonna kill us all dead
They mad, how'd this happen?
Gotta make sure that nobody else gets it
I'm sorry but I have it and you have it or you'll get it
So forget it, don't sweat it, just let it be
I'm telling you Ebola's not the enemy, listen!

I have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la

And the Cosbys could have Ebola, also Oprah
Let's just close up Detroit 'til this crisis is contained
Don't let the Obamas on the plane 'cause

They black, they could have Ebola
Might as well also watch for Arabs
If they have a brown face
We'll keep 'em safe in Guantanamo Bay
I'm sorry, everybody, for the drama
But we're gonna get Ebola if we let black people in
Ebola's not a country in Africa

All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food
All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food

Welcome to the veggie grill, hi, my name is Dave
And I am gay, what would you like today?
Just because I'm vegan, doesn't mean
I don't swallow cocks night and day, 'cause I am gay
If you ever had a bunny rabbit sleep next to you
If you ever had a chicken hen make sex to you
Then you get why it's bad to eat 'em in your food
Animals are friends, we all are gay

We feel that it's wrong to eat a little snail
We eat sweaty balls with a little kale
You should come to the vegan convention
You'll cum on several men's chins
If you're into having big cocks, swing next to you
If you ever had a pig stuck his penis into you
It brings meaning to the saying cockle doodle doo
After all, we're gay, nothin' more to say

All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food

Animals should not be on our plate
But, animals, they might be good to date
I'm out here, banging some homeless mutt
Looking for a set of monkey nuts

Ed Sheeran - I See Fire


Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
You might also like
Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

Neil Finn - Song of the Lonely Mountain

Far over the Misty Mountains rise
Leave us standing upon the height
What was before we see once more
Is our kingdom a distant light
Fiery mountain beneath the moon
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon
For home a song that echoes on
And all who find us will know the tune
Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the back of us yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long forgotten gold
We lay under the Misty Mountains cold
In slumbers deep, and dreams of gold
We must awake, our lives to make
And in the darkness a torch we hold
From long ago when lanterns burned
Until this day our hearts have yearned
Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone
What was stolen must be returned
You might also likeWe must awake and make the day
To find a song for heart and soul
Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the end of it yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Till we get our long forgotten gold
Far away the Misty Mountains cold

Leona Lewis - I See You (Theme From Avatar)


I see you
I see you

Walking through a dream, I see you
My light in darkness, breathing hope of new life
Now I live through you and you through me, enchanted
I pray in my heart that this dream never ends

I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love

You teach me how to see all that's beautiful
My senses touch a world I never pictured
Now I give my hope to you, I surrender
I pray in my heart that this world never ends

I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life, I offer my love, for you
You might also like
When my heart was never open
And my spirit never free
To the world that you have shown me
But my eyes could not envision
All the colors of love and of life evermore
Evermore

I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love

I see you

Na szlak moich blizn poprowadź palec
By nasze drogi spleść gwiazdom na przekór
Otwórz te rany, a potem zalecz
Aż w zawiły losu ułożą się wzór
Z moich snów uciekasz nad ranem
Cierpka jak agrest słodka jak bez...
Chcę śnić czarne loki splątane
Fiołkowe oczy mokre od łez...
Za wilczym śladem podążę w zamieć
I twoje serce wytropię uparte
Przez gniew i smutek, stwardniałe w kamień
Rozpalę usta smagane wiatrem
Z moich snów uciekasz nad ranem
Cierpka jak agrest, słodka jak bez...
Chce śnić czarne loki splątane
Fiołkowe oczy mokre od łez...
Nie wiem czy jesteś moim przeznaczeniem
Czy przez ślepy traf miłość nas związała?
Kiedy wyrzekłem moje życzenie
Czyś mnie wbrew sobie wtedy pokochała?
Z moich snów uciekasz nad ranem
Cierpka jak agrest słodka jak bez...
Chce śnić czarne loki splątane

From far away
In mountains deep
The night of blood
In twilight sleep
The armies fight
For king and queen
There will be no
No victory
The swords collide
With power and force
As mighty men
Show no remorse
It is the time
The snow is melting
It is the time
Of reckoning

Two Steps From Hell - Never Back Down

Standing still as they charge
We will hold our ground
Not back down
We will raise our swords
From the ground
And we will fight the war to end
All the suffering, never fearing
Heros foes or the daring
And their cause to the gods we pray
Never waive, time has come for us
To take charge and fight the power
Standing still as they charge
We will hold our ground

Two Steps From Hell - Star Sky



Here we are, riding the sky
Painting the night with the sun
You and I, mirrors of night
Twin flames of fire, lit in another time and place

I knew your name, I knew your face
Your love and grace
Past and present now embrace
Worlds collide in inner space
Unstoppable, the song we play

Burn the page for me
I cannot erase the time of sleep
I cannot be loved so set me free
I cannot deliver your love or caress your soul so
Turn that page for me
I cannot embrace the touch that you give
I cannot find solace in your words
I cannot deliver you your love
Or caress your soul

Age to age, I feel the call
Memory of future dreams
You and I, riding the sky
Keeping the fire bright
From another time and place

I know your name, I know your face
Your touch and grace
All of time cannot erase
What our hearts remember stays
Forever on a song we play

Burn the page for me
I cannot erase the time of sleep
I cannot be loved so set me free
I cannot deliver your love or caress your soul so

Tired mechanical heart
Beats 'til the song disappears

So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly

And shatter me

Lindsey Stirling - Something Wild


You had your maps drawn
You had other plans
To hang your hopes on
Every road they led you down felt so wrong
So you found another way
You've got a big heart
The way you see the world
It got you this far
You might have some bruises
And a few scars
But you know you're gonna be okay

Even though you're scared
You're stronger than you know

If you're lost out where the lights are blinding
Caught in all, the stars are hiding
That's when something wild calls you home, home
If you face the fear that keeps you frozen
Chase the sky into the ocean
That's when something wild calls you home, home

Sometimes the past can
Make the ground beneath you feel like quicksand
You don't have to worry
Reach for my hand
And I know you're gonna be okay

A spiderweb pulling back each movement that I make
Poor spider, I will burn your home in order to escape
And when the darkness grows onto my heavily loaded back
I'll shake it off my shoulders and I'll follow my own track

Run, run, run from the dragon, from the treason
Far enough 'til I reach a warmer season
Run, run, run, in the long run I'll recover
Pull myself out of this, demand no other
Run, run, run from the dragon, from the treason

Might seven years be all I have, for seven years I'd fight
When everything behind of me has finally disappeared
My body shall be put to rest, my spirit shall be freed

Patty Gurdy - One By One


Petal by petal your worries will settle, what will be and what won't?
Pressing your hands on the stinging nettle, hoping for cure, but it don't
I think I see how it got you to where you are now, a muddled up afterglow
Where you silently wander while hoping it won't crawl back on you as you go

They say that

One by one you gotta sow in ashes, grow and behold
Storm and sun are taking care so one day the blossom unfolds
One by one you gotta sow in ashes, grow and behold
Storm and sun are taking care so one day the blossom unfolds

Nobody placed you in the crossroad to pick out the bad or worse
Now going for worse than what you expected, that can't be how it goes!
But all of these people, they told you so, so how could it possibly be?
That loosening the knot and going your own way will definitely set you free

Now sing it

One by one you gotta sow in ashes, grow and behold
Storm and sun are taking care so one day the blossom unfolds

Patty Gurdy - The Longing - Hurdy Gurdy Version

I've seen many men wandering
All strong and brave and keen
Seen them growing into rulers
But I long for the sea
Heard a ship came from North
To our harbour for a day
And before misfortune knows
I'll be on my way
I'm all set to veer away
And I'm all set to go astray
All burdens I will leave ashore
To find what I've been longing for
Don't tell anyone
That this night I'll be gone
Greeting the eternal blue
Right at the break of dawn
Sailing t'wards the unknown
With my crew on the sea
And the day that I return
A hero I shall be
I'm all set to veer away
And I'm all set to go astray
All burdens I will leave ashore
To find what I've been longing forYou might also like

Patty Gurdy - Horizon Turns Red


The sky is turning gray
As I walk away
From where I was born
A thousand miles apart
My feet don't know the path
On which I have to go

And no one has succeeded
In drying my tears or save me from fears
Neither the gods would tell me
When that weight will be lifted from me
Not time nor a thousand miles can break our bond
My heart is heavy when you're not around
When you see the clouds dividing and horizon turns red
That's the day I will come back

Now you could never count
All those miles I'd walk
To return to you

Patty Gurdy - Luring

I'm the cold, cold water in the long, deep river
What is luring you is what will cause the deadly shiver
And all that's sacred is all that withers
And you were never keen, resisting all that's been
Forever I remain in waters never seen
I'm your personal mirror, cut to fit you forever
Evolving so that you can have your mortal steerer
Cause all that's sacred is all that's with us
And you were never keen, resisting all that's been
Forever I remain in waters never seen
When I saw the river the sun was up and blinding and
On the surface gleaming with no sight down
Should I stay till dusk? But I'd trifle away the joyous day!
So I kept on wandering, so alone
I see it can't be wrong, when we are always drawn
To cast our flaw along and stay until we're done
I'm the cold, cold water in the long deep river
What is luring you is what will cause the deadly shiver
And all that's sacred is all that withersYou might also like

Meja - All 'Bout the Money


Sometimes
I find another world inside my mind
When I realize the crazy things we do
It makes me feel ashamed to be alive
It makes me want to run away and hide

It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum da da dum dum
I don't think it's funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money
It's all 'bout the dum dum da da dum dum
And I think we got it all wrong anyway

We find strange ways
Of showing them how much we really care
When in fact we just don't seem to care at all
This pretty world is getting out of hand
So tell me how we fail to understand

It's all 'bout the money
All 'bout the dum dum da da dum dum
I don't think it's funny
To see us fade away
It's all 'bout the money

Heart - Alone


I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Kendji Girac - Andalouse


Tu viens le soir, danser sur des airs de guitare
Et puis tu bouges, tes cheveux noirs, tes lèvres rouges
Tu te balances, le reste n'a pas d'importance
Comme un soleil, tu me brûles et me réveilles

Tu as dans les yeux, le sud et le feu
Je t'ai dans la peau
Baila baila oh !

Toi, toi, ma belle andalouse
Aussi belle que jalouse
Quand tu danses le temps s'arrête
Je perds le nord, je perds la tête
Toi, ma belle espagnole
Quand tu bouges tes épaules
Je n'vois plus le monde autour
C'est peut-être ça l'amour

Des airs d'Orient, le sourire et le cœur brûlant
Regard ébène, j'aime te voir bouger comme une reine
Ton corps ondule, déjà mes pensées se bousculent
Comme la lumière, il n'y a que toi qui m'éclaires

Morandi - Angels (Love Is The Answer)


People stop fighting
Angels are crying
We can be better
Love is the answer


Search inside, are there any more tears to cry? (don't you wonder why)
Why you feel so alone all against the world? (world, world)
Search back time when you used to sing along (to the music of your soul)
Song of faith, you can change, it's not too late

Bloodhound Gang - The Bad Touch


Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
(I'd appreciate your input)

Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time," you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X-Files"

Oh-oh, oh, oh

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside

Michael Jackson - Billie Jean


She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)

Meredith Brooks - Bitch


I hate the world today
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way

Matthew Wilder - Break My Stride


Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

Blu Cantrell - Breathe (feat. E-40)


I met you in the hood, lookin' good of course
Eugenia Kim hat with a Michael Kors purse
Jimmy Choo boots and Thierry Mugler cologne
All I could think about was wantin' to bone
All I could think about was takin' you home
So you could jump my bone and we could moan and groan
And get our  on, not a one night fling
But a long term relationship thing

You say you love, say you love me
But you’re never there for me, yeah, (Yes I am, I am always do) mmm...hmm...
You’ll be cryin', slowly dyin'
When I decide to leave, oh, oh

All we do is make up
Then break up (that's true)
Why don’t we wake up
And see (okay)
When love hurts
It won’t work
Maybe we need some time alone (but what we need to do here?)
We need to let it breathe (okay)
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe (for sure)
Breathe

Then break up (that's right)

Summer, spring, winter and fall
I realize, love don't love me anymore
I'm still walkin' out that door
Waitin' for a cure (c'mon)
I wish that you could love me more
And give me what I'm lookin' for (right)
You used to be the one I adore
But now it seems I'm just not sure
E-40
If I don't work you call me sorry, good for nothin'
But when I'm at work you think I'm always up to somethin'
All I'm tryna do is make the bacon and bring home some ends
I ain't cheatin' girl, you need to stop listenin' to your friends
Girl, what chu wanna do, you wanna air it out and breathe? (Breathe)
Or do you wanna work it out and cleave?
The fact of the matter is 
But the problem is it's a big communication gap

Maybe we need some time alone
So we can just breathe (that's right)
Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe (Breathe, ah...)
Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Uh-huh)
Hey... hey... hey... hey...
Let it breathe, yeah
Oh... oh... breathe

When loneliness is knocking on your door
Everything you loved just disappears
And when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there's no life without tears

Oh oh oh oh
Tell me, black or white
What color is your life?
Oh oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart

No one is forever beautiful and young
Everything you know just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing, you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart
The choice is yours, who you really want to be
Don't be afraid of your destiny
So when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there's no life without fear

I thought I told y'all that we won't stop (We won't stop)
Till we back cruisin' through Harlem, these old blocks (Yeah)
It's what made me (Uh huh), saved me, drove me crazy (Oh, oh)
Drove me away (Come on), then embraced me (Yeah, yeah)
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings (Let's go) (Oh yeah)
Welcome to my homecomin' (Coming)
Yeah, it's been a long time comin'
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Come on) (Here I stand)
A better man (Don't stop) (A better man)
Thank you, Lord! (Thank you, Lord!)
Thank you all!
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home (Oh!)
Tell the world that I'm comin' home (I'm comin' home!)
Let the rain wash away (Feels so good!)
All the pain of yesterday (Feels so free!)
I know my kingdom awaits (Ain't no place like home, baby)
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Ain't no place like home!)
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home (I'm comin' home!) (I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home)
Tell the world that I'm comin' home (Tell the world I'm comin' home)

Yeah
Holla!

We come from humble beginnings and
Who could have guessed it when
You sit and doubt it and
Things ain't all that bright
But we made it through the night

Oh, it's like a game of truth or dare
If you can make it here
You'll make it anywhere
That's what we've been told
But the stories getting old

Together we faced the cold outside (Yeah yeah)
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go (No, no)
Together we faced our final fears
Remember the moments that we shared (Uh huh)

And I've done it but I've done it my way
I gotta read between the lines
Oh oh, in the script of my life

We started out many years ago
No one will ever know
How far we've really come
Since we walked away
With no more words to say, hey

And we made a lot of sacrifice
Undid a lot of ties
We fought a lot of fights
To get where we are now (Mm-mmh)
Just don't ask me how (No, no)

Together we faced the cold outside
No one can say we didn't try
And I will never give you up or let you go (Oh no)

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

Ô ma douce souffrance
Pourquoi s'acharner? Tu r'commences
Je n'suis qu'un être sans importance
Sans lui, je suis un peu paro
Je déambule seule dans l'métro
Une dernière danse
Pour oublier ma peine immense
Je veux m'enfuir que tout r'commence
Ô ma douce souffrance

J'remue le ciel, le jour, la nuit
Je danse avec le vent, la pluie
Un peu d'amour, un brin de miel
Et je danse, danse, danse, danse, danse, danse, danse
Et dans le bruit, je cours et j'ai peur
Est-ce mon tour ? Revient la douleur
Dans tout Paris, je m'abandonne
Et je m'envole, vole, vole, vole, vole, vole, vole

Que d'espérance
Sur ce chemin en ton absence
J'ai beau trimer, sans toi ma vie n'est qu'un décor qui brille, vide de sens

Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
And he just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich

Where beer does flow and men chunder

Glasperlenspiel - Echt


Alles was wir sehen, wohin wir gehen
Nur dieser Moment bleibt in der Sanduhr stehen
Wenn er echt ist
Ich erwart nicht viel von diesem Moment
Ich will dass er perfekt ist, dass er echt ist
(Dass er echt ist)

Und ich kann es noch gar nicht so richtig glauben
Doch du stehst hier direkt vor meinen Augen
Ich will dass es zwischen uns nicht nur so ein Affekt ist
Ich will dass es alles hier echt perfekt ist

Und ich glaub daran, dass es besser ist, wenn ich es fühlen kann
Für diesen einen Augenblick sind alle meine Zweifel weg

I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life


Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry)
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?

Lene Marlin - Here We Are


Keeping my distance
I look but I don't really see
It's like things lose their colour
And people are walking right through me
Do not pay attention
Not easy to see what's passing you by
I gave it a try
Did not see you coming my way

Now you wanna hold my hand
You chose to take it
The truth is that I never really thought we'd make it
Here we are, no chance I'm leaving
Ideas of love and life, it sure can be deceiving
Here we are now

How come it just happened?
At that moment, I sure didn't know
A purpose of meeting
Back then I did not believe so
Somehow you got to me
Never again will I put up a fight
When everything's right
Finally, everything's right

Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else
Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else
So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man

Remember that piano
So delightful, unusual
That classic sensation
Sentimental confusion

I used to say
I like Chopin
Love me now and again

Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's my way

Imagine your face
In a sunshine reflection
A vision of blue skies
Forever distractions

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

Father, forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me
'Cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

Melanie C - I Turn to You


When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you

When my insides are wracked with anxiety
You have the touch that will quiet me
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice
When I need inspiration, when I need advice

I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
You might also like
Where would I be?
What would I do?
If you'd never helped me through
I hope someday if you've lost your way
You could turn to me like I turn to you

I turn to you
Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you

I turn to you
When fear tells me to turn around
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you
I turn to you

Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh, things you never say to me
Oh, oh, tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent

Mm, oh

We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

(Ka-ching!)
Can you hear it ring? (Ka-ching!)
It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing

You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Uno por pobre y feo, home, pero antojao'
Ah, hijueputa

Tengo la camisa negra, hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena y es por culpa de tu embrujo
Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele

Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Je laisserai mes amours
Si tu me fais sur l'heure
Une place dans ton cœur
Je ne peux vivre que dans ta lumière
Avec toi j'irai jusqu'au bout de la Terre
Tous les jours
Souviens-toi de nos idéaux
Doux parfum du passé
J'ai gardé tous nos rêves au chaud
La Promesse n'est pas oubliée
La Promesse n'est pas oubliée
Les désirs me déchirent
Les secrets me dévorent
Retiens-moi je chavire
Quand j'ai la fièvre au corps
Tu es celui qui comprend mes silences
Un coup de coeur souffle de providence
Tous les jours

Je ne peux vivre que dans ta lumière

Sylver - Lay All Your Love On Me

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see
Is a potential threat
And I'm possessive
It isn't nice
You've heard me saying
That smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you...
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk
A smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know
What you've done with me
A grown-up woman
Should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear...
You might also likeDon't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long
And they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth
Even more incomprehensible
'cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do...
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay I don't feel safe
I don't feel safe

Left broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way

And I wonder if you know how it really feels
To be left outside alone when it's cold out here
Well, maybe you should know just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone

ABBA - Mamma Mia


I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

They say I shot a man down
For not picking up the check
What they don't know it won't hurt 'em
So keep moving down the line
Just cause I like my diamonds bright
Ain't saying I'm wrong or if it's right
But baby I haven't been wrong before

Cash is everything I need so show me the money!
Cash is everything I need so give it to me honey!
Oh what you see...is what you get!
And you ain't seen...nothing yet!

They say I broke a man down
For not giving me respect
Should've spent more cause worth I'm it
I just ain't got the time
You better choose your battles right
Shoot when you see whites' others' eyes
Oh baby I wish you had the dough
But you don't

Layin' in the bed that I made all alone
Guess I'm not surprised, honestly
Praying in my head that you stayed, and I hope
You'll miss me eventually

People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear
Really, they don't know what I'm made of
People keep on walking so far away from here
Clearly, I'm the one they're afraid of

One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm the monster that's been here all along?
They're droppin' like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

Bend until you break and you can't take any more
I'm not worth the trouble, it seems
I would say you're wrong, but I've been here before
You won't be the last one to leave

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this
Will you still recall my name
And the month it all began?
Will you release me with a kiss?
Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have, how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

Dazed by careless words
Cozy in my mind

I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight
Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night
Now, I hate to leave you bare
If you need me, I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down

Oh, yeah..
Uh
Never be the same again

I call you up whenever things go wrong
You're always there you are my shoulder to cry on
I can't believe it took me quite so long
To take the forbidden step
Is this something that I might regret?

Come on, come on
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
You are the one
The lonely heart that can't be tamed
Come on, come on
I'm hoping that you feel the same (Yeah!)
This is something that I can't forget

I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on

Uh, check it
Night and day
Black beach sand to red clay
The US to UK
NYC to LA
From sidewalks to highways
See it will never be the same, what I'm saying
My mind frame never changed so you came and rearranged
But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden
When there's no competition
And you render my condition
Though improbable it's not impossible
For a love that could be unstoppable, but wait
I find lines between fate and destiny
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly
And as our energies mix and begin to multiply
Everyday situations they start to simplify
So things will never be the same between you and I
We intertwine our life forces
And now we’re unified (yeah)
I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on
We'll never, never be the same again

Come on, come on
Our things will never be the same again
You are the one
Never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Never be the same again
Never be the same again
Never be the same again
Never be the same again

Bosson - One in a Million


You're one in a million, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're one in a million, ooh

Sometimes love can hit you every day
Sometimes,you can fall for everyone you see
But only one can really make me stay
A sign from the sky, said to me

You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

I've been looking for that special one
And I've been searching for someone to give my love
And when I thought that all the hope was gone
A smile, there you were, and I was gone (I was gone)
I always will remember how I felt that day
A feeling indescribable to me, yeah
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer
And you, you're the one, the one for me (Yeah)

(They tried to catch me, but it was impossible)
Nobody could hurt me, it was my game
Until I met you, baby, and you were the same
And when you (Didn't want me, I wanted you)
Because the funny thing about it is I like the show
(I like it when it's difficult, I like it when it's hard)
Then you know it's worth it, that you've found your heart (Found your heart)

Who can say where the road goes?
Where the day flows?
Only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose?
Only time


Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies?
Only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies?
Only time


Who can say when the roads meet?
That love might be in your heart?
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart?
Night keeps all your heart

You light up another cigarette
And I pour the wine
It's four o'clock in the morning
And it's starting to get light
Now I'm right where I want to be
Losing track of time
But I wish that it was still last night
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away lying by my side?

When I go away I'll miss you
And I will be thinking of you
Every night and day just

Promise me you'll wait for me
'Cause I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way, too
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon

Adele - Rolling in the Deep


There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Laura Branigan - Self Control


Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes
A safe night
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I'm living in the forest of a dream
(You take my self, you take my self control)
I know the night is not as it would seem

Adele - Set Fire to the Rain



I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain

I'm sitting down here
But hey, you can't see me

Your words cut rather deeply, they're just some other lies
I'm hiding from a distance, I've got to pay the price
Defending all against it, I really don't know why
You're obsessed with all my secrets, you always make me cry
You seem to wanna hurt me, no matter what I do
I'm telling just a couple, but somehow it gets to you
But I've learned how to get revenge and I swear you'll experience that someday

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kind of invisible, you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day
I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me

I'm not trying to avoid you, just don't wanna hear your voice
When you call me up so often, I don't really have a choice
You're talking like you know me and wanna be my friend
But that's really too late now, I won't try it once again
You may think that I'm a loser, that I don't really care
You may think that it's all forgotten, but you should be aware
'Cause I've learned to get revenge and I swear you'll experience that someday

Just thought I would join you for one day

Adele - Skyfall


This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

When it crumbles

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together

Tasmin Archer - Sleeping Satellite


I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Did we fly to the Moon too soon?
Did we squander the chance?
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure, woah

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights

Have we peaked too soon?

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died

And when we shoot for stars
What a giant step
Have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept?
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure, woah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah

Gotye - Somebody That I Used To Know


Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
You might also like

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)

Adele - Someone Like You


I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Katie Melua - Spider's Web

If a black man is racist, is it okay
If it's the white man's racism that made him that way
Because the bully's the victim they say
By some sense they're all the same
'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web
The piano keys are black and white
But they sound like a million colors in your mind
I could tell you to go to war
Or I could march for peace and fighting no more
How do I know which is right
And I hope he does when he sends you to fight
'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web
The piano keys are black and white
But they sound like a million colors in your mind
Should we act on a play
Or should we chase the moments away
Should we live, should we give
Remember forever the guns and the feathers in time
'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web
The piano keys are black and white
But they sound like a million colors in your mind

Oh, the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people, they were dancing to the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs, they get louder each one better than before

And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning
And your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs
Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning
And your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in, and nobody's home till four
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go and where you gonna sleep tonight

Rihanna - Unfaithful


Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

Tina Turner - We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)


Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children, the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome
You might also like
So what do we do with our lives?
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Jermaine Jackson - When The Rain Begins To Fall


Like the sand can seep right through your fingers
So can all your days
As those days go by
You'll have me there to help you find
The way I feel with you, I know it's got to last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright

Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream to just hold on
All my dreams of love began with the reality of
You and I believe that all our dreams will last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright
You might also like
Though the sun may hide
We still can see
The light that shines for you and me
We'll be together all that we can be

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all
And everything will be alright
And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall

ABBA - The Winner Takes It All


I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
You might also like
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)

Ricky Martin - Livin' la Vida Loca


She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain, come on

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on)

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on)

Katie Melua - Nine Million Bicycles


There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die

We are twelve billion light years from the edge
That's a guess
No one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you

I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday
So don't call me a liar
Just believe everything that I say
There are six billion people in the world
More or less, and it makes me feel quite small
But you're the one I love the most of all

We're high on the wire
With the world in our sight
And I'll never tire
Of the love that you give me every night

Sade - Smooth Operator


He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator

Pink Floyd - High Hopes



Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
You might also like

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever


"Hello?"
"Yeah?"
"Is that Charlie?"
"Yes."
"Hello, Charlie."
*phone hangs up*
"Great."

On a bridge across the Severn on a Saturday night
Susie meets the man of her dreams
He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
He doesn't want the company

But there's something in the air, they share a look in silence
And everything is understood
Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand
As the rain puts a tear in his eye

She says, "Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life"

Driving through the city to the Temple Station
He cries into the leather seat
And Susie knows the baby was a family man
But the world has got him down on his knees

So she throws him at the wall, her kisses burn like fire
And suddenly, he starts to believe
He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why
But he thinks that he begins to see

When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

Tom Odell - Another Love


I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights

I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
You might also like
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love

I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love

LP - Lost On You


When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from?
Burnin' like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender years ago
And will you know?

So smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven 'cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, oh
Tell me are they lost on you? Oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh
After everything I've lost on you, is that lost on you?
Oh, oh
Oh, is that lost on you?
Oh, oh
Baby, is that lost on you? Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine
You might also like
So smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you

Tell me are they lost on you? Oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh
After everything I've lost on you, is that lost on you?

Holly Henry - Crawl


I left it burning on the shelf
Lose enough sleep you’ll forget yourself
I know that lately it’s been hard
To know just who the hell we are
This conversation is sporadic
Learning lessons from an addict
One, two, three, four
I heard you talking on the phone
You think I want to be alone
You think you’re not supposed to be
The kind of boy in love with me

You say your mind is damaged goods
You might be damaged but you’re so good
You say your mind is damaged goods
You might be damaged but you’re
Come rest your tired thoughts here
You won’t make sense of us at all
Sometimes love lifts you higher
But sometimes love it makes you crawl

Doctors say it makes you depressed
To spend the whole day in your bed
That diagnosis may be right
But they never had you spend the night

Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear

Where will it lead us from here?

All your kisses still taste sweet

Genesis - Jesus He Knows Me


D'you see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday?
See the face on the billboard?
Well that man is me
On the cover of a magazine
There's no question why I'm smiling
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me

I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
You don't need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me

Cause Jesus, he knows me and he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus all my life
Oh yes, he knows me and he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything is alright

I believe in the family
With my ever-loving wife beside me
But she don't know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God?
Cause that is what I'm selling
And if you wanna get to heaven
Well, I'll see you right
You might also like
You won't even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You don't even have to touch that dial
Cause I'm everywhere

Jesus, he knows me and he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus all my life
Oh yes, he knows me and he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

Won't find me practising what I'm preaching
Won't find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Well, just do as I say, don't do as I do

Well, I'm counting my blessings
As I've found true happiness
Cause I'm a-getting richer day by day
You can find me in the phone book
Just call my toll-free number
You can do it anyway you want
Just do it right away
And there'll be no doubt in your mind
You'll believe everything I'm saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start paying

Cause Jesus, he knows me and he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus all my life
Oh yes, he knows me and he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright
Cause Jesus, he knows me and he knows I'm right
(Jesus, he knows, he knows)
Ooh, yes, he knows me and he knows I'm right

Genesis - Land of Confusion


I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

This is the world we live in (Oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
You might also like
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in (Oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
Yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
Now, this is the world we live in (Oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in (Oh, oh, oh)
And these are the names we're given (Oh, oh, oh)
Stand up and let's start showing (Oh, oh, oh)
Just where our lives are going to

She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying

She can't walk, but she's trying

Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(Don't you sit back and watch the beatin')
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about— (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about— (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Eminem - Talkin' 2 Myself


Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins, on the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God, it
Feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
"Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself
You're slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declinin' with your self-esteem, you're cryin' out for help"

If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
You pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)

Eminem - Not Afraid


I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
You might also like

Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Eminem - Almost Famous


I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost taste it

Yeah, can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming "Attack!" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous
You might also like
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, "Ahh!"
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous

Eminem - Love the Way You Lie


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You might also like
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem - Lose Yourself


Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)

ABBA - Lay All Your Love on Me


I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
You might also like
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

Gloria Gaynor - I Will Survive


At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

You might also like
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give

ABBA - One of Us


They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

Every day, here, you come walking
I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking
You say you're happy and you're doing fine
Well, go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time

Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie

Well, for a while, I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon, you'll be walking this way

Because sad eyes never lie
Because sad eyes never lie

But, baby, don't you know I don't care?
Don't you know that I've been there?
Well, if somethin' in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry, darling, it'll slip your mind
You might also like
I know you think you'd never be mine
Well, that's okay, baby, I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
Go ahead, I don't mind the act
You come all dressed up for a date
Well, one more step and it'll be too late
Blue, blue ribbon in your hair
Like you're so sure I'll be standing there

I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie, never lie

Sad eyes, sad, sad eyes
Sad eyes never lie

Imagine Dragons - Warriors


As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)

Michael Bolton - When a Man Loves a Woman

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on
To what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It oughta be, hey
When a man loves a woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him
Such misery
You might also likeIf she is playing him for a fool

Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell 'em
"I ain't second to none"

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee!

I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee!)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Mike Oldfield - Moonlight Shadow


The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on, worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven, far away
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven one day

Four A.M. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars move slowly in the silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night?
But she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven, far away
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven one day


Far away on the other side
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn't find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side
But she couldn't find how to push through

Murray Head - One Night in Bangkok


Bangkok, Oriental setting
The city don't know what the city is getting
The crème de la crème of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean Spa had the chess boards in it
All change, don't you know that when you
Play at this level, there's no ordinary venue?
It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings, or
Or this place

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples, but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city
What do ya mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea girls, warm and sweet (Warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine
You might also like
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlours

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples, but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me

The Rolling Stones - Anybody Seen My Baby


She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize that she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby?
Anybody seen her around?
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please

She believed he was a holy healer

There was a cat that really was gone

Became known to more and more people

But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
And he really came

They put some poison into his wine

They didn't quit, they wanted his head

This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat from old Chicago town

She was the meanest cat in old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat, she really mowed them down
She had no heart at all — no, no, no heart at all
She was the meanest cat, oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat, he wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along 'cause they were mean and strong

Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma

Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma

Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma

One day they robbed a bank, it was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon, they couldn't get away
And all the loot they had, it made them mighty mad

BOY (Pop) - Little Numbers


I'm waiting for your call and for the moon
To release me from the longest afternoon
I've rearranged parts of my living room
But time is hard to kill since I met you
I'm looking at the cars that drive on by
While spring is making promises outside
Red cars are quite rare, I realize
And then I wonder which color you would like

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart and

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I watch the sky change to a darker blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singer sounds as if she was longing
As if she was longing, too

On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all?
For me at all, tell me
I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all?

Elton John - Sacrifice


It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Wie wil horen een historie
Al van ene jonge smid
Die verbrand had zijn memorie
Daaglijks bij het vuur verhit
Was ik nog, nog met mijnen hamer
Was ik nog met geweld op mijn aambeeld
'k Geef den bras van al dat smeden
Ik ga naar de Franse zwier
'k Wil mij tot den trouw begeven
Nooit een schoner vrouw gezien
Was ik nog, nog met mijnen hamer
Was ik nog met geweld op mijn aambeeld
't Is de schoonste van de vrouwen
Maar nooit was er zo'n serpent
Nooit kan zij haar bakkes houden
Nooit is zij eens wel content
Was ik nog, nog met mijnen hamer
Was ik nog met geweld op mijn aambeeld
Nooit mag ik een pintje drinken
Nooit mag ik eens vrolijk zijn
Nooit kan ik iemand beschinken
Met een glaasje bier of wijn

Feel the rhythm

From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be
From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
I have to hold you in my arms now
There can never be another for me

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica, say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion?
Can you taste our love's sweet wine?
Join the dance and let it happen

And you fall under my spell
I will get you in my arms now

Quando sono solo
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
Sì, lo so che non c'è luce
In una stanza quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai acceso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce che
Hai incontrato per strada

Con te partirò
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso, sì, li vivrò
Con te partirò
Su navi per mari

Ay payita mía, guárdate la poesía
Guárdate la alegria pa' ti
Y oye, dámelo

No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Y tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella

Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adiós

Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay amor, es una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adiós

Y oye, dámelo
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mí que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Y como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

Ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte y me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando "Perdón"
Yo ya no voy a llorar hoy por ti

Phil Collins - Two Hearts


Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
You might also like
She knows (she knows)
There will always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

Madonna - Frozen


You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen, when your heart's not open

Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key

Sting - Englishman in New York


I don't drink coffee, I'll take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien

Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun


Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile

Coolio - Gangsta's Paradise


As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Rufus Wainwright - Hallelujah


I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, The major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken "Hallelujah"
You might also like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's real and going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you?
The holy dark was moving, too
And every breath we drew was "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

U2 - Ordinary Love


The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years, I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

Hozier - Take Me to Church


My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

With flowers and my love, both never to come back

Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

Simon & Garfunkel - The Sound of Silence


Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"

Depeche Mode - Enjoy the Silence


Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove, strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Eric Burdon & The Animals - House of the Rising Sun

1 ContributorHouse of the Rising Sun LyricsThere is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I've got one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many young poor boy
And God, I know I'm oneYou might also like

Wolves asleep amidst the trees
Bats all swaying in the breeze
But one soul lies anxious, wide awake
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags, and wraiths
For your dolly Polly, sleep has flown
Don't dare let her tremble alone
For the Witcher
Heartless cold
Paid in coin of gold
He comes, he'll go, leave naught behind
But heartache and woe
Deep, deep woe
Birds are silent for the night
Cows turned in as daylight dies
But one soul lies anxious wide awake
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags, and wraiths
My dear dolly Polly shut your еyes
Lie still, lie silеnt utter no cries
As the Witcher
Brave and bold
Paid in coin of gold

Ziehen die Vögel, wo mögen sie wohl morgen sein
Ich folge dem Rauschen der Schwingen in das stille Moor
Uralte Lieder dringen aus den Nebeln vor

Ashley Serena - My Jolly Sailor Bold


Ah, ah, ah
Ooh

Upon one summer's morning, I carefully did stray
Down by the Walls of Wapping, where I met a sailor gay
Conversing with a young lass who seemed to be in pain
Saying, "William, when you go, I fear you'll ne'er return again"

My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold

Oh, ah, oh

His hair, it hangs in ringlets, his eyes as black as coal
My happiness attend him wherever he may go
From Tower Hill to Blackwall, I'll wander, weep and moan
All for my jolly sailor, until he sails home

My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold

And I have left my parents and three thousand pounds a year
Come all you pretty fair maids, whoever you may be
Who love a jolly sailor that ploughs the raging sea
While up aloft in storm, from me his absence mourn
And firmly pray, arrive the day, he's never more to roam

My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold (Ah)
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold

Well she took me by the hand

Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit, light
Enter, night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land(yeah, alright)
Somethings wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

1 ContributorAce of spades LyricsIf you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man
You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
The ace of spades, the ace of spadesPlaying for the high one, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit, double stake or split
The ace of spades, the ace of spadesYou know I'm born to lose and gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it, baby
I don't wanna live for ever
And don't forget the jokerPushing up the ante, I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be

Mandowar - Far far away

1 ContributorFar far away LyricsI've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
I've seen the bridges of the world and they're for real;
I've had a red light of the wrist without me even gettin' kissed
It still seems so unreal
I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
I've seen the sunset in the east and in the west;
I've sang the glory that was Rome
And passed the hound dog singer's home;
It still seems for the best
And I'm far, far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far, far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud still as loud
I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
And felt the silence hanging low in no mans land;
And all those Spanish nights were fine
It wasn't only from the wine;
It still seems all in hand
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
The grand Bahama island stories carry on;
And all those arigato smiles
Stay in your memory for a while;
There still seems more to come

Van Canto - Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden cover)

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Van Canto - The Bard's Song: In The Forest (Blind Guardian cover)


Now you all know the bards and their songs
When hours have gone by I'll close my eyes
In a world far away we may meet again
But now hear my song about the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bard's song

Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bard's songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away, a feel of today
It will be gone due to our magic songs

There's only one song left in my mind
Tales of a brave man who lived far from here
Now the bard songs are over and it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name of the one who tells the story

Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bard's songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known and you're not alone
So don't be afraid in the dark and cold
But the bard's songs will remain, they all will remain
In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits, dwarfs and men
And elves come close your eyes
You can see them, tooYou might also like

Van Canto - Raise Your Horns (Amon Amarth cover)


Victory, we fought hard and prevailed
Brutally, we were fighting
Stormy seas, rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield, lit by lightning
Eagerly, we filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily, ravens cawing
Home shore calls, we return on bloody seas
Twilight falls, darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for bravе fallen friends
We will meet whеre the beer never ends

No regrets, we went out to war and strife
To protect, king and country
Victory, honour those who gave their life
Willingly, we will not grieve

With their lives as the price

Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt

Van Canto - Falling Down


I don't know the height from which I'm falling
I don't know the faces, the voices calling
Don't know the aftereffects of anything I'll do
I wait for the flow, one inspiration
I am eager to know all the ideation
I owe an explanation though

Should I recreate a fading past?
Or should I mitigate to the thoughts that last?
I fail to explain all the wonders, the images I drew
Is it burden or gift I have been given?
Easing or order, which life I'm living?
I'm desperate, if I only knew

In the second you stop thinking you will feel unconcerned
And satisfiеd with what you own
There is one combination that has been still unhеard
You are ready to know

I'm falling down
Still falling down
Lift me up if I ever hit solid grounds
I'm falling down
Still falling down
At the moment I'm letting go, I am falling down

I'm falling down
Still falling down
At the moment I'm letting go, I am falling down

The purpose of falling is to rise again into spheres
I haven't been before
I'm falling down, still falling down
The moment I'm letting go I am falling down
Now that I'm falling again I savor the endless ride
Now that I'm falling again I'm one with my time
Now that I'm falling again I roam to the other side
Now that I'm falling again I'm one with my life

Now that you're falling again you roam to the other side

You're falling, you're falling high

Remember the times you've been trying too hard
Higher and higher you climbed
But then, deep inside, it did not feel right
You seek to be falling alive

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Ta niedziela jest jak film, tani klasy "B"
Facet się pałęta w nim w nieciekawym tle
Scenarzysta forsę wziął, potem zaczął pić
I z dialogów wyszło dno, zero, czyli nic

Wszyscy święci balują w niebie
Złoty sypie się kurz
A ja włóczę się znów bez ciebie
I do piekła mam tuż

Tak bym chciał cię spotkać raz, w ten jedyny dzień
Lub o tydzień cofnąć czas, ale nie da się
Chociaż samotności smak aż do bólu znam
Kiedy innych niedziel brak, trudno, co mi tam

Wszyscy święci balują w niebie
Złoty sypie się kurz
A ja włóczę się znów bez ciebie
I do piekła mam tuż
Świat się tylko już ze mną kręci
Gwiazdy płoną jak stal
Skasowałaś mnie w swej pamięci
Aż mi siebie jest żal

Sza, cicho sza czas na ciszę
Już oddech jej coraz bliżej
Tego naprawdę Ci brak
Ona jedna prawdziwy ma smak
Cisza jak ta
Sza, cicho sza, zbliż się do niej
Drga, ledwie drga, blady płomień
Podejdź i zanurz się w nią
Rryształową i czystą jej toń
Zanurz do dna
REF:
Bliżej i bliżej, i bliżej, i bliżej
Masz do niej
Ciszej i ciszej, i ciszej, i ciszej
Co dnia
Kończ, po co ten ciągły hałas
Sam zdwoić go wciąż się starasz
Tak Cię uczyli od lat
Tylko krzykiem zdobywa się świat
A to nie tak, nie tak!
Sza, cicho sza, czas na ciszę
Tę, którą w swym sercu słyszysz
Kiedyś śpiewało, jak z nut
Teraz gładkie i zimne jak, lód
Smutny to cud, o smutny cud!

Kryształową i czystą jej toń
Cisza jak ta, jak ta...

Budka Suflera - Jest Taki Samotny Dom

Uderzył deszcz, wybuchła noc, przy drodze pusty dwór
W katedrach drzew, w przyłbicach gór, wagnerowski ton
Za witraża dziwnym szkłem, pustych komnat chłód
W szary pył rozbity czas, martwy, pusty dwór
Dorzucam drew, bo ogień zgasł, ciągle burza trwa
Nagle feeria barw i mnóstwo świec, ktoś na skrzypcach gra
Gotyckie odrzwia chylą się i skrzypiąc suną w bok
I biała pani płynie z nich w brylantowej mgle
Zawirował z nami dwór, rudych włosów płomień
Nad górami lecę, lecę z nią, różę trzyma w dłoni
A po nocy przychodzi dzień, a po burzy spokój
Nagle ptaki budzą mnie, tłukąc się do okien
A po nocy przychodzi dzień, a po burzy spokój
(Znowu szary, pusty dom, gdzie schroniłem się)
Nagle ptaki budzą mnie, tłukąc się do okien
(I najmilsza z wszystkich, wszystkich mi - na witraża szkle)
A po nocy przychodzi dzień, a po burzy spokój
(Znowu w drogę, w drogę trzeba iść, w życie się zanurzyć)
Nagle ptaki budzą mnie, tłukąc się do okien
(Chociaż w ręce jeszcze tkwi lekko zwiędła róża)

Budka Suflera - Ratujmy Co Się Da

1 ContributorRatujmy Co Się Da LyricsZa horyzontem wielka korona gór
Na karoserii różowieje kurz
Odsuwasz dach, w rękę łapiesz wiatr
Powiedz prawdę, ile lat mnie kochasz?
Droga ucieka, noga już ciężka jest
Opór decha i z oczu znika sen
Będzie nam najbliższych czasem brak
Spalone mosty to najlepszy w życiu start
Ratujmy co się da
Obróćmy jeszcze raz
Kalejdoskop
Wóz tnie powietrze, jak nóż weselny tort
W najbliższym mieście każę obudzić dzwon
Za marzenia słono płaci się
Lecz życie tak niepowtarzalne jest
Wyciągasz palce wtedy, gdy zmieniam bieg
Gdzieś zniknął pancerz, który krępował mnie
Wolność ma tak śmiesznie słony smak
Mnie też żal tamtych, zakręconych lat
Ratujmy co się da
Obróćmy jeszcze raz
Kalejdoskop
You might also likePamiętam, jak do miasta raz zjechał na dzień wielki cyrk
Po przedstawieniu byłaś zła
Bo chciałem w świat z cyrkiem iść
Na karuzelę musiałem cię wziąć
By pęd osuszył ci łzy
Tunel miłości jak noc objął nas
Pocałowałaś mnie tam pierwszy raz
Obiecywałaś pół nieba mi dać
Wyjechał cyrk, a ty z nim zniknęłaś
Odrosła trawa, gdzie stał diabelski młyn
Po czterech latach wróciłaś, ale z kimś
Wnet zrozumiałem, że ja tylko tracę czas
I wyjechałem, by pokazać na co mnie stać
Co za historia, w powietrzu wisi kicz
W promieniach słońca blacha jak złota lśni
Każdy nit w silniku cały drży
Wszyscy pragną szczęśliwego końca
Twoja sukienka przed czasem zdradza mi
To, co mnie czeka być może jeszcze dziś
Przez dziesięć lat wyśniłem dzień po dniu
Wielką ucieczkę, najdłuższą drogę do twych...
Za horyzontem niepewność czeka nas
Gnamy jak pocisk prosto w objęcia dnia
Odsuwasz dach i w rękę łapiesz wiatr
Powiedz mi prawdę, ile lat mnie kochasz!

Budka Suflera - Takie Tango

1 ContributorTakie Tango LyricsNa sali wielkiej i błyszczącej
Tak jak nocne Buenos Aires
Które nie chce spać
Orkiestra stroi instrumenty
Daje znak i zaraz zacznie
Nowe tango grać
Siedzimy obok obojętni
Wobec siebie jak turyści
Wystukując rytm
Nie będzie tanga między nami
Choćby nawet cud się ziścił
Nie pomoże nic
Chociaż płyną ostre nuty
W żyłach płonie krew
Nigdy żadne z nas do tańca
Nie poderwie się
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Zgodnych ciał i chętnych serc
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Tak ten świat złożony jest
Zaleje w końcu Buenos Aires
Noc tak gęsta jak atrament
A gdy przyjdzie brzask
Co było w naszych sercach kiedyś
Kiedyś jak świecący diament
Cały straci blask
You might also likeI choć będą znowu grali
Bóg to jeden wie
Nigdy razem na tej sali
Nie spotkamy się
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Zgodnych ciał i chętnych serc
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Tak ten świat złożony jest
Może kiedyś na tej sali
Tam będziemy tańczyć tango
Bo te kłótnie nic nie znaczą
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Zgodnych ciał i chętnych serc
Bo do tanga trzeba dwojga
Tak ten świat złożony jest

Budka Suflera - Za Ostatni Grosz

Jaki jest wynik gry
Nie wiem, nie pytaj mnie
Jak na imię tej grze
Tego nie wiem już też
Wczoraj tak było tak
Nie znaczyło zaś nie
Nie mieszało się nam
Czarne z białym co dzień
Wczoraj niewinni tak
Dzisiaj pionki w grze
Wczoraj błękitny wiatr
Dzisiaj duszny zły sen
Z drugiej strony mych snów
Wszystko lepszy ma smak
Bo w powietrzu jest luz
I muzyka wciąż gra
Za ostatni grosz
Kupię dziś chociaż cień
Tamtych dni
Za ostatni grosz
Wino z zielonych lat
Chcę znów pić
You might also likeKiedy zaczął się wić
Kręty, pochyły szlak
Gdzie był pierwszy nasz krok
W rozpadlinę bez dna
Gdy srebrników garść
Przekonała nas, że
Kiedy dają, to brać
Każdy głupi to wie
Bilans zysków i strat
Prowadzimy od lat
Nie ma czego w nim kryć
Nie ma czego się bać
Skąd więc na lustra dnie
Z progu każdego dnia
Wita cię najpierw wstręt
Potem brat jego strach

Czerwone Gitary - Ciągle Pada



Ciągle pada!
Asfalt ulic jest dziś śliski jak brzuch ryby
Mokre niebo się opuszcza coraz niżej
Żeby przejrzeć się w marszczonej deszczem wodzie
A ja?
A ja chodzę desperacko i na przekór wszystkim moknę
Patrzę w niebo, chwytam w usta deszczu krople
Patrzą na mnie rozpłaszczone twarze w oknie, to nic!

Ciągle pada!
Ludzie biegną, bo się bardzo boją deszczu
Stoją w bramie, ledwie się w tej bramie mieszcząc
Ludzie skaczą przez kałuże na swej drodze
A ja?
A ja chodzę, nie przejmując się ulewą ani spiesząc
Czując, jak mi krople deszczu usta pieszczą
Ze złożonym parasolem idę pieszo, o tak!

Ciągle pada!
Alejkami już strumienie wody płyną
Jakaś para się okryła peleryną
Przyglądając się, jak mokną bzy w ogrodzie
A ja?
A ja chodzę w strugach wody, ale z czołem podniesionym
Żadna siła mnie nie zmusza i nie goni
Idę niby zwiastun burzy z kwiatkiem w dłoni, o tak!

Ani piorun, który trafił obok drzewa
Słucham wiatru, który wciąż inaczej śpiewa

Szybkie, niekrótkie tak, bo już myślisz, gdzie masz iść
Numer mam, zdzwońmy się, by się spotkać, lecz wiem
Znów nie wyjdzie z tego nic
Czy to takie trudne choć raz

Póki na to czas, pogadamy jak za dawnych lat
Póki na to czas, wypijemy za to co dał świat
Póki na to czas, pogadamy tak jak ludzie stąd
Póki na to czas, póki na to czas
Póki na to czas
I nie o tym kogo znasz, nie o tym co masz
Tylko po to, żeby mieć
I nie o tym kim się jest z kim, co można i gdzie
I co w zamian można chcieć
Czy to takie trudne choć raz
Zmienić rzeczy bieg

Szare sine ciężkie niebo
Zobaczyłem Cie za oknem
Wejdź do domu to nie zmokniesz
Może Ciebie tam nie było
Tylko ze mną coś się stało
Znów mnie oszukała miłość
Tak pragnąłem Twego ciała
I widzę tylko Twoje kapelusze......
Jak statki na niebie x4
Ciemne chmury wiatr przegonił
Kiedy chciałem je dogonić
I zmieniła się pogoda
Wiem, ze jutro Cie tu spotkam
Teraz sobie przypominam
Dzisiaj tutaj być nie mogłaś
Przecież jeszcze nie wróciłaś
Może lepiej, bo nie zmokłaś
I widzę tylko Twoje kapelusze........

Więc nie warto mieć niczego, tylko karmić zmysły
Będzie co ma być. Już wiem, że stąd nie zwieje
Poczekam i popatrzę, nie cofnę kijem Wisły
Już tylko Kiler, o sobie tylko tyle
Wiem co za ile, nie muszę dbać o bilet
Mam wszystko w tyle, są czasem takie chwile
Że się nie mylę, choć wcale nie wiem ile
Nie kiwnąłem nawet palcem, by się znaleźć w takiej walce
Teraz w pace swe ostatnie resztki imidżu tracę
Co się ze mną dzieje, naprawdę nie istnieje
Więc nie warto tak się bronić, tylko lecieć z wiatrem
Poczekam, popatrzę - zrozumiem więcej
I wtedy wreszcie sam też włącze się do akcji
Już tylko Kiler, o sobie tylko tyle
Wiem co za ile, nie muszę dbać o bilet

Wierzyłem że mnie kiedyś szczęście spotka
No powiedz jak dostałeś się do środka
Na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj
I oto w sercu radość chociaż w głowie mrok
Lustrzana kula wirowała całą noc
Dziewczyna jak bogini choć idiotka
Ale powiedz jak dostałeś się do środka
Na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj
Na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj na krzywy ryj
Pomogła mi w życiu przygoda z lokalem LUXEDEN

Hey - Moja i Twoja nadzieja


Spróbuj powiedzieć to, nim uwierzysz, że
Nie warto mówić kocham
Spróbuj uczynić gest, nim uwierzysz, że
Nic nie warto robić

Nic, naprawdę nic, nie pomoże
Jeśli ty nie pomożesz dziś miłości
Nic, naprawdę nic, nie pomoże
Jeśli ty nie pomożesz dziś miłości

Musisz odnaleźć nadzieję
I nieważne że nazwą ciebie głupcem
Musisz pozwolić by sny
Sprawiły byś pamiętał, że

Nic, naprawdę nic, nie pomoże
Jeśli ty nie pomożesz dziś miłości
Nic, naprawdę nic, nie pomoże
Jeśli ty nie pomożesz dziś miłości

Moja i Twoja nadzieja
Uczyni realnym krok w chmurach
Moja i Twoja nadzieja
Pozwoli uczynić dziś cuda

Hey - Teksański

Herbata stygnie, zapada zmrok
A pod piórem ciągle nic
Obowiązek obowiązkiem jest
Piosenka musi posiadać tekst
Gdyby chociaż mucha zjawiła sie
Mogłabym ja zabić
A później to opisać...
W moich słowach słoma czai się
Nie znaczą nic
Jesli szukasz sensu, prawdy w nich -
Zawiedziesz sie
A może zmienić zasady gry?
Chcesz usłyszeć słowa
To sam je sobie wymyśl
Nabij diabła, chmure śmierci weź -
Pomoże Ci Wnet twe mysli w słowa zmienią sie
Wyśpiewasz je sam

IRA (POL) - Nadzieja

Może masz w głowie myśli bardziej szalone niż ja
Może masz skrzydła, których by Tobie pozazdrościł ptak
Może masz serce całe ze szlachetnego szkła
Może masz kogoś, a może własnie kogoś Ci brak
Nie płacz, nie płacz, o nie
Może masz oczy, w których nie gościł dotąd strach
Może masz w sobie niechęć do wojny i brudnych spraw
Może masz litość, a może uczuć już w Tobie brak
Może masz wszystko lecz nie masz tego co mam ja
Nie ma nikt takiej nadziei jak ja
Nie ma nikt takiej wiary w ludzi cały ten świat
Nie ma nikt tylu zmarnowanych lat
Nie ma nikt bo któż to wszystko mieć by chciał

Jeden Osiem L - Jak zapomnieć


Ile dałbym, by zapomnieć Cię
Wszystkie chwile te, które są na nie
Bo chcę, nie myśleć o tym już
Zdmuchnąć wszystkie wspomnienia niczym zaległy kurz
Tak już, po prostu nie pamiętać
Sytuacji, w których serce klęka
Wiem, nie wyrwę się, chociaż bardzo chcę
Mam nadzieję, że to wiesz i Ty

Znowu widzę Ciebie przed swoimi oczami
Znowu zasnąć nie mogę, owładnięty marzeniami
Wszystko poświęcam myśli, że byłaś kiedyś blisko
Kiedy czułem Ciebie obok, wtedy czułem, że mam wszystko
Tyle zostało po mnie, tylko Ty i setki wspomnień
Ile dałbym za to, by móc o tym już zapomnieć
Teraz nie ma Nas i nie chcę być tam gdzie Ty jesteś
Znowu staniesz przede mną, zawsze robisz mi to we śnie
Będę patrzył jak odchodzisz, chociaż chciałbym się odwrócić
Będę myślał ile dałbym komuś kto by czas zawrócił
Kto by zatrzymał wskazówki, tylko na ten jeden moment
W chwili, w której Cię poznałem poszedłbym już w drugą stronę

Ile dałbym, by zapomnieć Cię
Wszystkie chwile te, które są na nie
Bo chcę, nie myśleć o tym już
Zdmuchnąć wszystkie wspomnienia niczym zaległy kurz
Tak już, po prostu nie pamiętać
Sytuacji, w których serce klęka
Wiem, nie wyrwę się, chociaż bardzo chcę

To był sen na jawie, gdy marzenia się spełniały
Wszystko takie realne, chwile szybko tak mijały
Tylko my, zamknięci w czterech ścianach, a tak wolni
Ważna Ty byłaś obok, a ja czułem się spokojny
Pamiętasz jeszcze? Te dni, całe miesiące
Pamiętasz? Chcesz zapomnieć? Ja nie mogę, wiem, że błądzę
Snute kiedyś opowiastki, ja, Ty i srebrna taca
Kiedyś to nie przerażało, już do tego nie chcę wracać
Aura zepsucia w powietrzu, tracisz te 50 procent
Chcę zapomnieć o Tobie, zatrzeć w pamięci te noce
By odeszły w niepamięć, chwile, które zwałem złotem
Tamte chwile to tombak, bo już wiem co było potem

Ile dałbym, by zapomnieć Cię
Wszystkie chwile te, które są na nie
Bo chcę, nie myśleć o tym już
Zdmuchnąć wszystkie wspomnienia niczym zaległy kurz
Tak już, po prostu nie pamiętać
Sytuacji, w których serce klęka
Wiem, nie wyrwę się, chociaż bardzo chcę
Mam nadzieję, że to wiesz i Ty

Moje myśli spiętrzone wokół jednej chwili
Kiedyś ta krótka potrafiła czas umilić
Teraz stojąc jakby obok wciąż się przyglądam
Już nie cieszy jak kiedyś, wspominam, myślę dokąd zdążam
Inne cele w życiu, inne plany i pragnienia
Muszę wszystko pozmieniać, tak jak czas wszystko zmienia
To co było nie wróci, wiem, choć czasem mam nadzieję
Po co mam więc pamiętać, ktoś by powiedział "stare dzieje"
Wiem to, nie mogę zapomnieć jak było dobrze
Wiem to, skończyło się, mój własny pogrzeb
Wiem to, i proszę Boga, nigdy więcej
Niech nie pozwoli na to, by ktoś trafił w moje serce
Ile dałbym, by zapomnieć Cię
Wszystkie chwile te, które są na nie
Bo chcę, nie myśleć o tym już
Zdmuchnąć wszystkie wspomnienia niczym zaległy kurz
Tak już, po prostu nie pamiętać
Sytuacji, w których serce klęka
Wiem, nie wyrwę się, chociaż bardzo chcę
Mam nadzieję, że to wiesz i Ty

Kazik - Mars napada


Hej, hej — Mars napada
Dookoła ludzi gromada
Hej, hej — Mars atakuje
Żadnej litości nie czuje
Hej, hej — Mars napada
Owoce pracy naszej zjada
Hej, hej — ludkowie biedni
Kolejny zlew powszedni

Nad Bałtykiem rozpostarli swoje skrzydła ludzie z Marsa
Atakować w taki sposób to jest jedna wielka farsa
Motłoch gapi się zdziwiony, nowej szuka podniety
Cywilizacja wroga z innej planety
W Gdyni zbiera się pospiesznie sztab kryzysowy
Albo anty, ryba psuje się od głowy
A każdy z prawem tutaj jest na bakier
John Malkovich jak grał Ruska to mówił madier fakier
Inwazja planetarna do plaży się zbliża
W tym czasie w sztabie w Gdyni jeden drugim ubliżał
Co to był za film, co na nim wciąż się ruchali?
Tu za heroinę, panie, ludzie wszystko by oddali
Wszystkie deski obsikane, wszystkie kible osrane
Jaki piękny jest nasz port, gdy się go widzi nad ranem
Wszystko poukładane, dużo dobrej roboty
Do portu się zbliżają z Marsa istoty

W tym całym bałaganie jedno wiem na pewno
Jesteś moją królewną

Do Bydgoszczy zbliża flota się totalnie uzbrojona
Popularny pięściarz, jego twarz jakaś znajoma
Dwóch rywali pokonał na potańcówce w Mózgu
I boi się mafii, chyba trafił na Rusków
Dzięki słusznym decyzjom nie ma śladów paniki
Stan wyjątkowy — zawsze smaczny i zdrowy
Podobno jeszcze broni się Gdańsk Orunia
Agresorzy mają rzut beretem już do Torunia
Czy to, że grasz na gitarze, uszczęśliwia innych ludzi?
Czy ma sens, że się trudzisz? Weź, nie pierdol, to mnie nudzi!
Radio Marii nadaje, chociaż pod bombardowaniem
Toruń ma już status twierdzy na obrony zawołanie
Z Marsa generałowie pokazują ważne cele
Przerażony lud szuka nadziei w kościele
Nie wiedzą biedacy, że nie pójdą już do pracy
Wszyscy Polacy na jednej leżą tacy
Hej, hej — Mars napada
Przerażonej tłuszczy gromada
Hej, hej — Mars atakuje
Jak kochanie się czujesz?
Hej, hej — Mars napada
Lada traktor, traktor Lada
Hej, hej — Mars atakuje
Na prostych ludzi poluje
A w tym całym burdelu jedno wiem na pewno
Jesteś moją królewną, zwiewną

To Warszawa winna przyjąć cały ciężar ataku
Bo jednostki doborowe i kompanie honorowe
Prezydent nie uciekł do Rumunii, jak kiedyś
Postawmy tamę coraz to nowym obszarom biedy
Ninja rocksteady, mówią, że jestem Żydem
Ale wiary mało we mnie, nie jestem chasydem
Stadion Legii wycelował jupitery w obce statki
Těžkej Pokondr, wypuśćcie Krakena z klatki
Uciekając z Sejmu posłowie pogubili notatki
Teraz wszyscy się dowiedzą, jakie miały być podatki
A ile nakradliśta, lecz co począć z taką wiedzą
Kiedy okupanci z Marsa już nam na plecach siedzą?
Jeden koleś, co w Londynie od kilku lat żyje
Twierdzi, że w akademikach najlepiej się pije
Zachodnia flota — Śląsk, wschodnia — na Kraków
Kraków — dawna stolica Polaków
Hej, hej — Mars napada
Dookoła ludzi gromada
Hej, hej — Mars atakuje
Żadnej litości nie czuje
Hej, hej- napada Mars
Płonie ziemia skąd Sawa i Wars
Hej, hej — u wrót stoi głód
Nie rzucim ziemi skąd nasz ród!
W tym całym bałaganie jedno wiem na pewno
Ty jesteś moją królewną

Moje włosy dęba stają, oczy nie dowierzają
Oni mają pusto we łbach, za babami latają
Powiedz, proszę, jak poeta ukochał swą ojczyznę
We Francji popracuję i języka liznę, liznę
Najpierw dobrobyt, a potem demokracja
Akcja na wakacjach, kolejna męki stacja
W Katowicach ruch oporu z najeźdźcą walczy
Wojewoda Ziętek z nieba na wszystko patrzy
Nad Krakowem, dla odmiany, małe grupki powstańców
Proszę nie wypuszczać psów bez kagańców!
Lokalnymi potyczkami związały siły wroga
Wszędzie ruchawka, zniszczenia i pożoga
Militarystyczne siły Marsa z pewnej oddali
Przesuwają się na zachód, Wisła się pali (pali, pali, pali)!
Gruszkę można walić takoż pod obraz i z pamięci
Choć już płonął, to krzyczał: A jednak się kręci!
A jednak się kręci Słońce dookoła Ziemi
Zaświadczą o tym księża palcami swemi
Hitler powtarzał też, że nie chce wojny wcale
Czemu ciągle do mnie mówisz per ty, pedale?
Wojenna armada na Wrocław się kieruje
Może Pan Bóg się nad nimi ulituje?
Może nas uratuje? To już zamknięcie matni
Wrocław od zawsze poddaje się ostatni

Temu, czy temu
Zrób to samemu
I ja też tu byłam
Sama sobie zrobiłam

Hej, hej — Mars napada

Ziemia twa ma inny kształt: kostki wziętej z gry
Stoisz u fortuny bram, butem kopiąc w drzwi, o, o, o

Krzyczysz: większy kontrast, tylko czerń i biel!
W życiu nie ma środka, kochaj, rządź i dziel
Twa zakrętka pali mnie, chociaż tęczy szał
Skąd tak dobrze znamy się, jestem taki sam

Trudno tak razem być nam ze sobą
Bez Ciebie nie jest lżej

Ulice odbijają szary smutek nieba
W sercu czuję chłód samotnej nocy
Zapach czarnej kawy, filiżanki ciepło
Jak przystań gdy wokół, burzy się szaleństwo
Zasłonięte okna, cieniste podwórza
Tych cichych dramatów, sceny nie zliczone
Gdy sił mi brak, śnię o słonecznych czasach
Tych wspólnie z tobą spędzonych

Trudno tak razem być nam ze sobą
Bez Ciebie nie jest lżej
Lecz trzeba nam, trzeba dbać o tę miłość
Nie wolno stracić jej, nam nie wolno stracić jej

W twoim śnie jestem gwiazdą, ze starego romansu
Twe łzy niczym kołdra na moim nagim ciele
Smak kawy cię budzi, a minuty wciąż płyną
Myśli ciążą bardziej, niż wczorajsze wino

Ech ci ludzie, to brudne świnie
Co napletli o mojej dziewczynie
Jakieś bzdury o jej nałogach
No to po prostu litość i trwoga
Tak to bywa, gdy ktoś zazdrości
Kiedy brak mu własnej miłości
Plotki płodzi, mnie nie zaszkodzi żadne obce zło
Na mój sposób widzieć ją

Na głowie, kwietny ma wianek
W ręku zielony badylek
A przed nią bieży baranek
A nad nią lata motylek
A przed nią bieży baranek
A nad nią lata motylek

Krzywdę robią mojej panience
Opluć chcą ją podli zboczeńcy
Utopić chcą ją w morzu zawiści
Paranoicy, podli sadyści
Utaplani w brudnej rozpuście
A na gębach fałszywy uśmiech
Byle zagnać do swego bagna, ale wara wam
Ja ją przecież lepiej znam

Łąka na niebie się kończy
Ja tańczę, tańczę na słońcu
Słowo na które czekałem
Padło z Twoich ust w końcu
Tańczę, ja tańczę na łące
Przecież łąka to słońce
Mądrze świat został stworzony
Dzięki za to Ci Ojcze
Łąka na niebie się kończy
Ja tańczę, tańczę na słońcu
Słowo na które czekałem

Kult - Celina

Tę burzę włosów każdy zna
Przy ustach dłoni chwiejny gest
Tak to Celina, Celina, Celina jest
Jak hejnał grzmi jej śmiech
Gdy całe miasto śpi
Nie wytrzeźwiała od soboty
Balet trwa już cztery dni
I w twiście wozi się w piorunach klipsów
Na potłuczonym szkle
La, la, la zaśpiewał w barze ktoś
To czarny Ziutek pije gin
Celiny koleś twardy gość pije cztery dni
Wychylił setną ćwierć
Powietrze zaraz wyszło z niego
W kliniczną popadł śmierć
Liczko pobladło mu jak wosk
Ziutek pozbył się swych od Celiny trosk
Zapamiętajcie sobie radę, którą dziś wam wszystkim dam
Możecie liczyć na przyjaciół pomogą wam
Ziutkowi minął kac kolesie w kocioł wzięli go
Szukaj Celiny Lamusie gdzie adapter chata szkło
Ziutek nie płakał twardy jest
Godzinę ze wściekłości wył jak pies
You might also likeTak, tak, tak Celina już na złom
To czarny Ziutek z kilerami pod Celiny idzie dom
Oświetlił błysk ich kos w rynku bramy brzeg
Sikory złote pod mankietem odmierzają sekund bieg
I stoi pikiet sak
Pod oknem w sieni i u drzwi dać tylko znak
Zasłony w oknach leją blask na mecie jasno jakby w dzień
Tak to Celiny, Celiny, Celiny cień
Dłonie kołyszą się egzotyczne kwiaty dwa
Celina naga na balecie pośród żądz i szkła
Wtem nagle jakiś ruch
W progu staje rudy Mundek Ziutka druh
Dzyń, dzyń, dzyń, dzyń, dzyń, dzyń
To prysło w oknie szkło
Celina naga w noc ucieka
Jakie dno, o jakie dno
Już tylko chce się jej do piekła skryć
Och Ziutek, Ziutek gdzieś ty był, kiedy ja zaczynałam pić?
Dlaczegoś nie bił w pysk?
Lecz milczy noc i tylko kosy świeci błysk
Dlaczego taki ostry był Ziutkowej kosy szpic?
Przecież znacie te balety wszak w nich złego nie ma nic
Ale Celiny głos Celiny włosów woń
Czerwoną mgłą zasnuwa oczy w kamień zwiera dłoń
Ziutek tylko podniósł brew błysnęło na białą pierś trysnęła krew
Słuchaj to jęknął świat jak chory pies u pana stóp
Tak to Celinie, Celinie, Celinie kopią grób
W rynku syren jęk na jezdni żółty kurz
Niebieska szklanka miga, blacharnia Ziutka zwija już
I odtąd spoza krat Ziutek i Mundek bez Celiny widzą świat
Lecz czasem, gdy jest noc Ziutek wytęża słuch
Tak to Celiny, Celiny, Celiny duch
Wiecie, więc że ja was bawiłem śpiewem swym
Tylko dla zwykłej draki w ogóle prawdy nie ma w tym
To zwykły kawał jest darujcie to już ballady kres

Kult - Dziewczyna bez zęba na przedzie

Wybrałem Cię spośród milionów
Wybrałem tak jak mogłem wtedy najlepiej
Wpuściłem Cię do swego domu
Nie myślałem o tym, co gdzie i kiedy
Ten dzień przywitał nas ulewą
W tym wietrze z syfu z listopada
Uciekłaś wtedy moją stroną lewą
To jeszcze jest głupota, czy już zdrada
Czy myślałaś o tym, co się może stać między nami dwojgiem
Tu stać się może coś nowego
Czy myślałaś o tym, co się stać może między nami dwojgiem
Tu stać się może coś strasznego
Ten uśmiech Twój każdego ranka
Przypomnę sobie będąc w biedzie
Byłaś mi matką i kochanką
Dziewczyno, bez zęba na przedzie!
Zrobiłaś to, co zrobić chciałaś
Kto dobrze wie nie musi pytać nic
Przyszłaś, ujrzałaś i wygrałaś
Zostałem, tak jak stałem, zupełnie sam, czy...
Czy myślałaś o tym, co się stać może między nami dwojgiem

Kult - Gdy nie ma dzieci

Jedna flaszka, druga flaszka i też trzecia, kurde bele, leci
Dom stoi zupełnie pusty nocą kurzą się dookoła rupiecie

Będziemy zorganizowani i poważni, uczesani i przezorni
Jednak jeszcze dzisiaj i jutro, pojutrze i popojutrze
Pozwól nocy kochana, życiu nosa utrzeć

Podzielony granicami
Z ludźmi, których kochasz
Rozmawiasz tylko listami
Czujesz ich jedynie przy pomocy pocztowego kleju
Tylko dlatego, że mieszkają w innym kraju
Na tym świecie każdy jest zachłanny i pazerny
Na tym świecie każdy chce pieniądze i koncerny
Kilku frajerów rządzi świata tego polityką
A potężniejsi z nich myślą o władzy nad galaktyką
Co za fatalny świat

Co za okropny świat

Na gardle tak, że aż tracę dech
Zabijam go po morderczej walce
Budzę się i gdzie już jestem, wiem

Zajadłych tak
Że nawet Bóg

Gotowych do walk o byle co
Dookoła wre, stan totalnej wojny

Nie pytaj jej o nic
Nie odpowie ci
Nie pytaj jak minął
Cały tydzień zły
W szkole, w domu
Wciąż to samo
Że czasami chce się wyć
Sam pomyśl - jak długo
Można w cnocie żyć?
Z piątku na sobotę
Idzie raz va banque
Zabłąkany motyl
Mała Lady Punk
We włosach paciorki
I niebieskie brwi
Złocona żyletka
W klapie kurtki lśni
Po koncercie, pod hotelem
Jak uparty czeka psiak
Aż idol z gitarą
Wreszcie da jej znak

Aniołowie jeśli tylko są
Kryją się w metalowych bunkrach
Takie listy szybko drą
Chcą mnie dziś, chcą mnie widzieć jutro
Paru kumpli już tam jest
Mówią, że krzyżyk piecze w usta
Nauczeni nie bać się
Tylko coś nie pozwala usnąć
Zawsze iść - rozkaz, który mam we krwi
Małą wojnę w sobie mieć
Z każdym z was walczyć do utraty tchu
I bez słów...
Mogę zwalić ciebie z nóg
Wrogu mój, co wykrzywiasz usta
Nie przepraszaj, tylko wstań
Nigdy już nie zobaczysz lustra
Ludzie są po to, żeby żyć i tańczyć
Ludzie są po to, żeby mogli walczyć
Ludzie są i nie będą nigdy lepsi

Za szampana łyk

Stała pod ścianą sącząc kakao
Kapela cięła walca na sześć
Spytałem skromnie: „czy pójdziesz do mnie?”
Kiwnęła głową zgadzając się:
Trzeba zawsze żyć biegnącą chwilą
Na co komu dziś wczorajszy dzień
Topiłem smutki w butelce wódki
Obok Japończyk do lustra pił
Pytam żółtego: „powiedz dlaczego
Też jesteś smutny?” On na to mi:
Na co komu dziś wczorajsza miłość
Na co komu dziś wczorajszy sen
Po co dalej pić to samo piwo
Kiedy czujesz, że uleciał gaz
Chciałem być sobą za wielką wodą
Na czekoladę poczułem chęć
Była namiętna, bardzo nieletnia
I dobrze znała refrenu sens

I deko mały kryje się cierń
W tej palecie dominuje czerń
Wolne wybory chyba to znasz
Co cztery lata do urny gnasz
Aż ze zdziwienia mięknie ci dziób
Wrzucasz kartkę i wybierasz drób

Lady Pank - Tacy sami

Samotna i zła
Jakbyś z planety była zimnej
Tak to długo trwa
Że nikt nigdy nie znał ciebie innej
Daleka jak sen
Wciąż nie dostrzegasz spraw i ludzi
A gdzieś czeka ten
Który kiedyś wreszcie cię obudzi
Tak dobrze cię znam...
Chyba nawet lepiej niż ty siebie
Jestem taki sam...
Wciąż widzę setki plam na niebie
Nieufność to mgła
Co przynosi tylko ciszę
Jak klatka ze szkła
Nie pozwala nam się słyszeć

Co kąsa tak bez uprzedzenia
Ja wiem jak to jest...
Znam to przecież, znam, aż do znudzenia

Lady Pank - Tańcz głupia, tańcz

U "maxima" w gdyni
Znów cię widział ktoś
Sypał zielonymi
Mahoniowy gość
Boney m. zagrało
Kelner zgiął się wpół
Potem odjechało
Złote bmw
Tańcz głupia, tańcz
Swoim życiem się baw !
Wprost na spotkanie ognia leć !
Tańcz głupia, tańcz
Wielki bal sobie spraw !
To wszystko, co dziś możesz mieć...
Sama tego chciałaś...
Pewnie coś był wart
Zapłacony ciałem
Kolorowy slajd
Tańcz głupia, tańcz...
Czasem tak dla hecy
Lubię patrzeć jak
Coraz bliżej świecy
Ruda krąży ćma

Lady Pank - Zamki na piasku


Jesteś idolem wielbi cię tłum
Gdzie się pojawisz słychać
Zdumionych głosów szum
W porannej prasie widzisz
Codziennie swoją twarz
Z możnymi tego świata
O wielkie stawki grasz

Zamki na piasku
Gdy pełno w szkle
Poranna witaj zmiano
To życie twe

Idziesz ulicą
Uśmiechasz się
Skonstruowałeś bombę
Skondensowaną śmierć
Znasz datę i godzinę
Gdy świat się zacznie bać
Policja wszystkich krajów
Rysopis twój chce znać

Zamki na piasku
Gdy pełno w szkle
Poranna witaj zmiano

Lady Pank - Zawsze Tam Gdzie Ty



Zamienię każdy oddech w niespokojny wiatr
By zabrał mnie z powrotem tam, gdzie masz swój świat
Poskładam wszystkie szepty w jeden ciepły krzyk
Żeby znalazł cię aż tam gdzie pochowałaś sny

Już teraz wiem, że dni są tylko po to
By do Ciebie wracać każdą nocą złotą
Nie znam słów, co mają jakiś większy sens
Jeśli tylko jedno, jedno tylko wiem
Być tam, zawsze tam, gdzie Ty

Nie pytaj mnie o jutro, to za tysiąc lat
Płyniemy białą łódką w niezbadany czas
Poskładam nasze szepty w jeden ciepły krzyk
By już nie uciekły nam, by wysuszyły łzy

Już teraz wiem, że dni są tylko po to
By do Ciebie wracać każdą nocą złotą
Nie znam słów, co mają jakiś większy sens
Jeśli tylko jedno, jedno tylko wiem
Być tam, zawsze tam, gdzie Ty

Ja wierzę, oni tańczą wciąż
Oni żyją swoim życiem
I dopłyną tam gdzie chcą
I wierzę w ich podwodny świat
A orkiestra, która grała
Do tej chwili gra

Mierzy kolię swą

Pada twarzą w tort
Nieprawda, że już nie ma ich
Oni płyną, tylko wolniej
Tak jak wolno płyną sny
I nieprawda, nie znajdziecie ich
Tyle mil już przepłynęli
Tyle przetańczyli dni
Młody milioner
Dziś zakochał się
Bal już się zaczął
Wszyscy tańczą - więc...
Nie przerywajcie tego
Zostawcie Titanica
Nie wyciągajcie go

I oni tańczą wciąż

Lombard - Przeżyj To Sam

1 ContributorPrzeżyj To Sam LyricsNa życie patrzysz bez emocji
Na przekór czasom i ludziom wbrew
Gdziekolwiek jesteś w dzień czy w nocy
Oczyma widza oglądasz grę
Ktoś inny zmienia świat za Ciebie
Nadstawia głowę, podnosi krzyk
A Ty z daleka, bo tak lepiej
I w razie czego nie tracisz nic
Przeżyj to sam, przeżyj to sam
Nie zamieniaj serca w twardy głaz
Póki jeszcze serce masz
Widziałeś wczoraj znów w dzienniku
Zmęczonych ludzi wzburzony tłum
I jeden szczegół wzrok Twój przykuł
Ogromne morze ludzkich głów
A spiker cedził ostre słowa
Od których nagła wzbierała złość
I począł w Tobie gniew kiełkować
Aż pomyślałeś: milczenia dość
Przeżyj to sam...You might also like

Nad ogromną betonową wsią
Z wolna gaśnie słoneczna żarówka
Pod ogromną betonową wieś
Kocim krokiem podchodzi szarówka
Już z ogonków wycofały się
Frasobliwe kolejek madonny
Do kapliczek powracają, gdzie
Telewizor z prognozą pogody
Szklana pogoda
Szyby niebieskie do telewizorów
Szklana pogoda
Szklanka naciąga bez humoru
Szklana pogoda
Rygle, zamki zabezpieczą drzwi
Szklany judasz gości skontroluje
Noc nie straszna, kiedy kłódki trzy
Na złodzieja bracie narychtujesz
Windy szumią śpiewankę do snu
Sąsiad pacierz klepie na kolanach
Może jeszcze raz się uda znów
Przetrwać noc I doczołgać do rana

Spójrz, wystawy śmieją się z nas
A ty wybrałaś znów właśnie mnie
Bo wiesz, że gdy zimno, ubiorę
I do siebie wezmę cię

I niech noc przykryje nas
Jak końca świata świat
W obawie przed świtaniem
Niczym król Karol kupię ci korale planet
I w nich samych przy mnie staniesz

Świat w ramionach twoich jak ja
Największy siłacz od lat
To dziś staniemy znów twarzą w twarz
Chodź, patrz jak walczę
I wiesz - bez ziół Smakujesz mi
Prorocze miewam sny
Jak pies gdy śpi przy Tobie
Więc chodź, kopuła niebios drży
Jak chleb smakujesz mi
Ruszymy z posad bryłę świata

I niech noc przykryje nas
Jak końca świata świat
W obawie przed świtaniem

Marek Grechuta - Dni, Których Nie Znamy


Tyle było dni do utraty sił
Do utraty tchu tyle było chwil
Gdy żałujesz tych, z których nie masz nic
Jedno warto znać, jedno tylko wiedz, że

Ważne są tylko te dni, których jeszcze nie znamy
Ważnych jest kilka tych chwil, tych, na które czekamy
Ważne są tylko te dni, których jeszcze nie znamy
Ważnych jest kilka tych chwil, tych, na które czekamy

Pewien znany ktoś, kto miał dom i sad
Zgubił nagle sens i w złe kręgi wpadł
Choć majątek prysł, on nie stoczył się
Wytłumaczyć umiał sobie wtedy właśnie że

Ważne są tylko te dni, których jeszcze nie znamy
Ważnych jest kilka tych chwil, tych, na które czekamy
Ważne są tylko te dni, których jeszcze nie znamy
Ważnych jest kilka tych chwil, tych, na które czekamy

Jak rozpoznać ludzi, których już nie znamy
Jak pozbierać myśli z tych nieposkładanych
Jak oddzielić nagle serce od rozumu
Jak usłyszeć siebie pośród śpiewu tłumu
Jak rozpoznać ludzi, których już nie znamy
Jak pozbierać myśli z tych nieposkładanych
Jak odnaleźć nagle radość i nadzieję
Odpowiedzi szukaj, czasu jest niewiele

Pachniała Saska Kępa
Szalonym zielonym bzem
To był maj
Gotowa była ta sukienka
I noc się stawała dniem
Już zapisani byliśmy w urzędzie
Białe koszule na sznurze schły
Nie wiedziałam

Gdy tamtą dziewczynę
Pod rękę ujrzałam z nim

Małgośka kochaj nas, na smutki przyjdzie czas
Zaśpiewaj raz, zatańcz raz

Życie kochanie trwa tyle co taniec
Fandango, bolero, be-bop
Manna, hosanna, różaniec i szaniec
I jazda, i basta, i stop
Bal to najdłuższy na jaki nas proszą
Nie grają na bis, chociaż żal
Zanim więc serca upadłość ogłoszą
Na bal, marsz na bal
Szalejcie aorty, ja idę na korty
Roboto ty w rękach się pal
Miasta nieczułe mijajcie jak porty
Bo życie, bo życie to bal
Bufet jak bufet jest zaopatrzony
Zależy czy tu, czy gdzieś tam
Tańcz póki żyjesz i śmiej się do żony
I pij... zdrowie dam!

Niech żyje bal!
Bo to życie to bal jest nad bale!

Albo feta proletariatu
Czasem podróż w najlepszym z aut
Częściej szare drogi powiatu

Wciąż wyrywa głupie serce
Ale to już było, znikło gdzieś za nami
Choć w papierach lat przybyło to naprawdę
Wciąż jesteśmy tacy sami

I wywiadów pełne gazety

I w sypialni dzieci oddechy
One lecą droga do gwiazd
Przez niebieski ocean nieba

Perfect - Autobiografia

Miałem dziesięć lat
Gdy usłyszał o nim świat
W mej piwnicy był nasz klub
Kumpel radio zniósł
Usłyszałem blue suede shoes
I nie mogłem w nocy spać
Wiatr odnowy wiał (wujek Józek zmarł)
Darowano reszty kar
Znów się można było śmiać
W kawiarniany gwar
Jak tornado jazz się wdarł
I ja też chciałem grać
Ojciec, bóg wie gdzie
Martenowski stawiał piec
Mnie paznokieć z palca zszedł
Z gryfu został wiór
Grałem milion różnych bzdur
I poznałem co to seks
Pocztówkowy szał
Każdy z nas ich pięćset miał
Zamiast nowej pary jeans
A w sobotnią noc
Był Luxemburg, chata, szkło
Jakże się chciało żyć!
Było nas trzech
W każdym z nas inna krew
Ale jeden przyświecał nam cel
Za kilka lat
Mieć u stóp cały świat
Wszystkiego w brud
Alpagi łyk
I dyskusje po świt
Niecierpliwy w nas ciskał się duch
Ktoś dostał w nos
To popłakał się ktoś
Coś działo się
Poróżniła nas
Za jej Poli Raksy twarz
Każdy by się zabić dał
W pewną letnią noc
Gdzieś na dach wyniosłem koc
I dostałem to, com chciał
Powiedziała mi
Że kłopoty mogą być
Ja jej, że egzamin mam
Odkręciła gaz
Nie zapukał nikt na czas
Znów jak pies, byłem sam
Stu różnych ról
Czym ugasić mój ból
Nauczyło mnie życie jak nikt
W wyrku na wznak
Przechlapałem swój czas
Najlepszy czas
W knajpie dla braw
Klezmer kazał mi grać
Takie rzeczy że jeszcze mi wstyd
Pewnego dnia
Zrozumiałem, że ja
Nie umiem nic
Słuchaj mnie tam!
Pokonałem się sam
Oto wyśnił się wielki mój sen
Tysięczny tłum
Spija słowa z mych ust
Kochają mnie
W hotelu fan
Mówi: "na taśmie mam
To jak w gardłach im rodzi się śpiew"
Otwieram drzwi
I nie mówię już nic

Kiedy dręczy cię ból

Głupich telefonicznych wróżek zza siedmiu mórz

Telewizor, meble, mały fiat, oto marzeń szczyt
Hej prorocy moi z gniewnych lat, obrastacie w tłuszcz
Już was w swoje szpony dopadł szmal, zdrada płynie z ust
Żegnam was, już wiem

Perfect - Niepokonani



Gdy emocje już opadną
Jak po wielkiej bitwie kurz
Gdy nie można mocą żadną
Wykrzyczanych cofnąć słów
Czy w milczeniu białych, haniebnych flag
Zejść z barykady
Czy podobnym być do skały
Posypując solą ból
Jak posag pychy samotnie stać

Gdy ktoś, kto mi jest światełkiem
Gaśnie nagle w biały dzień
Gdy na drodze za zakrętem
Przeznaczenie spotka mnie
Czy w bezsilnej złości, łykając żal
Dać się powalić
Czy się każdą chwilą bawić
Aż do końca wierząc, że
Los inny mi pisany jest

Płyniemy przez wielki Babilon
Dopóki miłość nie złowi nas
W korowodzie zmysłów możemy trwać
Niepokonani
Nim się ogień w nas wypali
Nim ocean naszych snów
Łyżeczką się odmierzyć da

Perfect - Niewiele Ci Mogę Dać

Sto gorących słów, gdy na dworze mróz
W niewyspaną noc, jeden koc
Solo moich ust, gitarowy blues
Kilka dróg na skrót, parę stów...
Nie mogę Ci wiele dać
Nie mogę ci wiele dać
Bo sam niewiele mam
Nie mogę dać wiele Ci
Nie mogę dać wiele Ci
Przykro mi
Osiem znanych nut, McCartney'a but
Kilka niezłych płyt, jeden kicz
Siedem chudych lat
Talię zgranych kart
Południowy głód, kurz i brud
Nie mogę Ci wiele dać
Nie mogę ci wiele dać

Jeden dzień, jedna noc
A w życiu jakby piękniej
Byłem z nią parę chwil
Było tak namiętnie
A teraz jestem tu, ludzi tłum
A myśli takie dziwne
Nie wiem, czy sam tego chcę
Lecz nikt tu nie jest winny

Myślę, że nie stało się nic
Myślę, że nie stało się nic

Już jakiś czas nie ma jej
Tańczę, wódkę piję

Więc śpieszmy się z toastami, ten toast odmłodzi Cię

Za młodzi na sen, za starzy na grzech
Wypijmy przy stole za błędy na dole by ich było mniej
Nie pijmy za błędy na górze Tam nie zmienia się nic mimo lat
Znasz prawdę o głowie i murze, daj spokój za piękny świat
Nie dajmy się też zwariować, a gdy jest naprawdę źle
Pod dach przyjaciół się schowaj I ten toast z nami wznieś
Za młodzi na sen, za starzy na grzech
Wypijmy przy stole by tu na dole źle nie działo się

Jedzie pociąg, złe wagony
Do więzienia wiozą mnie
Świat ma tylko cztery strony
A w tym świecie nie ma mnie
Gdy swe oczy otworzyłem
Wielki żal ogarnął mnie
Po policzkach łzy spłynęły
Zrozumiałem wtedy, że...
Czarny chleb i czarna kawa
Opętani samotnością
Myślą swą szukają szczęścia
Które zwie się wolnością
Czarny, czarny chleb i czarna kawa
Opętani samotnością
Myślą swą szukają szczęścia
Które zwie się wolnością!
Młodsza siostra zapytała:
"Mamo, gdzie braciszek mój?"
(Brat twój w ciemnej celi siedzi)

Grzesiek Kubiak, czyli Kuba rządził naszą podstawówką
Po lekcjach na boisku ganiał za mną z cegłówką
W Pile było jak w Chile, każdy miał czerwone ryło
Mniej lub bardziej to pamiętasz - spytaj jak to było
W czasach gdy nad Piłą jeszcze latały samoloty
Wojewoda Śliwiński kazał pomalować płoty
Potem wszystkie płoty w Pile miały kolor zieleni
Rogaczem na wieżowcu Piła witała jeleni

Żaden spleen i cud, na ulicach nie śpią złotówki
W Pile Święta jest Rodzina i święte są żarówki
Nic nie szkodzi, że z wieczora miasto dławi się w fetorach
Ważne że jest żużel i kiełbasy senatora!

Wybudujemy wieżę
Wieżę, wieżę, wieżę

Swój środek świata więc gdzie indziej każdy ma
Lecz wieża Babel zawsze jest marzeniem

Bo odliczanie zawsze
Kończy się na zerze
Nad szczyty gór

Uwierz o kosmos nie jest trudno w naszej erze

T.Love - Chłopaki Nie Płaczą

Mówisz życie jak cukierek
Gorzkie jest czasami
Mówisz panna zostawiła
Kumple dawno cię olali
Ale nie bój nic - minie jakiś czas
Poczuj chłodny świt, wszystko przjedzie ci
Uuh, chłopaki
Uuh, nie płaczą
Nie masz kaski - odpuść sobie
Jutro przecież też jest dzień
Może kiedyś ci pomogę
Może ty nie wystawisz mnie
Ale nie bój nic - minie jakiś czas
Poczuj chłodny świt, wszystko przjedzie ci
Uuh, chłopaki

T.Love - I Love You

Olewam rząd, mandaty drogowe
Dilerów, maklerów, warty honorowe
I jeszcze wąsacza olewam na zdrowie
Prymasa w lampasach, komuchy nie lubię
Tylko na Tobie naprawdę mi zależy
Tylko Ciebie naprawdę potrzebuję
I kiedy, kiedy znikasz, kiedy Ciebie nie ma
W powietrzu czuję, czegoś mi brakuje
Ludzie mówią, że jestem pijakiem
Chodnikowym równym chłopakiem
Ludzie mówią, że nie trzymam tonacji
Nie ćwiczę gam nowej demokracji
Ale ja mam w sobie mordercę
Wojownika, chcę zjeść Twoje serce
Chcę mieć w Tobie przyjaciela
Poczuć coś, poczuć coś, coś Ci dać
Oh yeah! Chcę Ci powiedzieć
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh yeah! Nie jestem mądry

Telepatycznie, telefonicznie
Wiem, o czym myślisz, wiem czego chcesz
Olewam złączonych w organizacjach

T.Love - King

Mówiono o nim King
W mieście Świętej Wieży
Pamiętam z podstawówki
Jak całował się z papieżem
Przejeżdżał też sekretarz
Gdy przecinano wstęgę
Kingy poszedł na wagary
Pomarzyć o czymś innym
Był zawsze trochę z boku
Na bakier trochę był
W szkole nikt nie wiedział
Czym King naprawdę żył
To było trochę później
Miał przyjaciółkę Ewę
Mieszkali więc bez ślubu
I klepali słodką biedę
Dawali czasem czadu
Bo lubili lekkie dragi
Znajomych było wielu
Wieczory i poranki
Uważaj na sąsiadów swych
Bo lubią dawać cynk
Ty wiesz kto rządzi w mieście
Tu biskup z komisarzem, King
You might also likeTak mówił mu przyjaciel
Długi, chudy Lolo
Kiedy wyszli na ulicę
Zapalić spliffa z colą
Mam dosyć tego miasta
Czerwono-czarnej mafii
Czy mnie rozumiesz Lolo
Czy wiesz co mnie trapi
W mieszkaniu blada Ewa
Wytłumaczyć pragnie wszystko
Bo komisarz wszedł przez okno
A spod łóżka wylazł biskup
Co masz w kieszeni, King?
Komisarz spytał w drzwiach
Palicie wciąż to świństwo
Mieliśmy wiele skarg
A biskup łypie z boku
To na Kinga, to na Ewę
Wy żyjecie tu bezbożnie
Myślicie, że nic nie wiem?
Za posiadanie zielska
Dostaniesz dziesięć latek
Za nielegalny związek z nią
Następnych parę kratek
Dziś Kingy siedzi w celi
Wspomina dobre dni
Napisał do papieża
Bardzo długi list
Świąteczną wysłał kartkę
Do samego prezydenta
Lecz nikt o nim już nie mówi
Nikt o nim nie pamięta

T.Love - Lucy Phere

Więc Lucyfer rzekł do mnie
Pogadajmy spokojnie
Hej chłopaku, jak chcesz dźwignąć swój los?
Nawet głupi ci mówi
Nie podskoczysz królowi
Lepiej ze mną nabijaj swój trzos
Chodźmy razem więc w drogę
Będziesz mówił o Bogu
Ja ci zrobię fantastyczny PR
Kiedy trzeba się schowam
Kiedy trzeba zachowam
Jestem Lucy, a ty będziesz big star
Popatrz jak tu jest pięknie
Już czekają dziewczęta
Mówią słodko, wielbimy dziś cię
Moja trawa zielona
Kokainy ramiona
Mogą pomóc jeśli będzie ci źle
Me królestwo jest wielkie
To co ludzkie jest piękne
Możesz mówić, że Bóg to twój dar
Mocno ściśnij me dłonie
I pamiętaj o żonie
Ja ci zrobię fantastyczny PR
You might also likeMój alkohol ma power
Na twe smutki i żale
Teraz dobrze to czujesz i wiesz
Nawet Jezus pił wino
Więc się napij z dziewczyną
A po kłótni najlepszy jest seks
Patrz kobiety cię pragnę
Coraz mocniej cię łakną
Jesteś królem dziś większym niż Bóg
Ja to wszystko sprawiłem
Ja ci dałem tę siłę
Teraz chłopcze, czas spłacić swój dług
Teraz należysz do mnie
Ja cię srodze upodlę
Możesz mówić, ze Bóg to twój wódz
Będziesz taplał się w błocie
Kiedy trzeba pomogę
Ale potem upodlę cię znów
Lucy, ja już nie mogę
Wolę chyba być z Bogiem
Czemu na mnie uparłeś tak się
Nie wymiękaj dziecino
Jesteś moją ptaszyną
Będę z tobą na dobre i złe
Jestem najlepszym kumplem
Posmutniałeś okrutnie
Ja zachcianki potrzeby twe znam
Powiedz czy chcesz do baru
Czy do konfesjonału
Jeśli trzeba zaprowadzę cię tam
Chodźmy razem więc w drogę
Będziesz mówił o Bogu
Ja ci zrobię fantastyczny PR
Kiedy trzeba się schowam
Kiedy trzeba zachowam
Jestem Lucy Phere a ty będziesz big star
Kiedy trzeba się schowam

T.Love - Pielgrzym

Poruszam nogą, ruszam ręką
To jest chyba pierwszy krok
Wolno poruszam się do przodu
Idę prosto, skręcam w bok
Myślałem, że mnie tutaj nie ma
Że już opuściłem kraj
Jednak powstałem, idę dalej
Mijam piekło, mijam raj
Więc dokąd, dokąd ta wędrówka
Posmutniał król i zadął w róg, łu-hu!
Przeciwnik straszy, pielgrzym idzie
A pyta zawsze Bóg
Jeszcze raz
Mijam królestwa tego świata
Mijam miasta, krwawy tron
Mijam haremy, mijam dżungle
Cesarzy i ich zgon
Więc dokąd, dokąd ta wędrówka
Posmutniał król i zadął w róg, łu-hu!

Tak bardzo lubię czuć się chory, czuć się chory
O jaka jesteś rozpieprzona
Słodko rozwala, coś wibruje, coś przytłacza mnie
O jakie w naszych oczach śpią demony

T.Love - Warszawa

Za oknem zimowo zaczyna się dzień
Zaczynam kolejny dzień życia
Wyglądam przez okno, na oczach mam sen
A Grochów się budzi z przepicia
Wypity alkohol uderza w tętnice
Autobus tapla się w śniegu
Przez szybę oglądam betonu stolicę
Już jestem na drugim jej brzegu
Gdy patrzę w twe oczy, zmęczone jak moje
To kocham to miasto, zmęczone jak ja
Gdzie Hitler i Stalin zrobili, co swoje
Gdzie wiosna spaliną oddycha
Krakowskie Przedmieście zalane jest słońcem
Wirujesz jak obłok, wynurzasz się z bramy
A ja jestem głodny, tak bardzo głodny
Kochanie, nakarmisz mnie snami
Zielony Żoliborz, pieprzony Żoliborz
Rozkwita na drzewach, na krzewach
Ściekami z rzeki kompletnie pijany
Chcę krzyczeć, chcę ryczeć, chcę śpiewać
Gdy patrzę w twe oczy, zmęczone jak moje
To kocham to miasto, zmęczone jak ja
Gdzie Hitler i Stalin zrobili, co swoje
Gdzie wiosna spaliną oddycha

Video - Ktoś Nowy

Jak tylko słońce wstanie
I zmieni się pogoda
Zabiorę się na spacer
Pójdę przed sobą schować
Nie wiem gdzie
Prawdopodobnie tam, gdzie chcę
Wymyślę się od nowa
Poskładam się inaczej
Ubiorę w nowe słowa
Najlepiej jak potrafię
Kilka zmian
I będę tym, kim będę chciał
Brak mi już powietrza
Brakuje w płucach tchu
Za długo czekam już na zmianę
Dziś potrzebny mi ktoś nowy
Taki ktoś, jak Ty
I kto pół nocy na mnie czekałby
Gdy korytarzem czołgam się do drzwi nad ranem
Dziś potrzebny mi ktoś nowy
Taki ktoś, jak Ty
Kto w korowodzie czarno-białych dni
Będzie, jak nagły dopływ świeżej krwi na stałe

Im bardziej uciec chcę
Tym mocniej trzyma mnie za karę

Gdy korytarzem czołgam się do drzwi nad ranem

Robię nic
I czego bym nie zrobił
I tak za każdym razem
Te same słyszę głosy
Te same widzę twarze
Czarny kot
Przebiega drogę mi co noc
Nawet gdybym nie chciał
Każdy kolejny dzień wygląda tak, jak ten
Co dalej?

Kolorowe neony, światła aut, cisza bram
Zaciemnione witryny jak świątynie bogów dnia
Nocny bar jest jak Atlantyda łez
Idę sam, zanim noc się spotka z dniem

Nigdy nie powiem ci, nie powiem ci
Jak to jest, kiedy nocą włóczę się
Nigdy nie powiem ci, nie powiem ci
Jak to jest, kiedy nocą włóczę się
Nie powiem ci

Znowu nie mogę spać, luna wciąż uwodzi mnie
Mokry chodnika blask, miasto pachnie inaczej jak w dzień
Nocny bar jest jak Atlantyda łez
Wychodzę sam, zanim ty obudzisz się

Nigdy nie powiem ci, nie powiem ci
Jak to jest, kiedy nocą włóczę się
Nigdy nie powiem ci, nie powiem ci
Jak to jest, kiedy nocą włóczę się
Nie powiem ci
Nigdy nie powiem ci, nie powiem ci

Ania styl, a Zośka coś, co lubię, ej
Ela całowała cudnie
Nawet tuż, po swoim ślubie
Z Kaśką można było konie kraść
Chociaż wiem, ze chciała przeżyć
Ze mną swój pierwszy raz
Magda - zło, Jolka mnie
Zagłaskałaby na śmierć
A Agnieszka, zdradzała mnie

Piękne jak okręt
Pod pełnymi żaglami
Jak konie w galopie
Jak niebo nad nami

Oh, Karolina w Hollywood
Z Aśką nigdy nie było tak samo
Ewelina zimna jak lód
Więc na noc, umówiłem się z Alą
Wszystko mógłbym Izie dać - tak jak Oli
Ale one wcale nie chciały brać

Aż onieśmielała mnie
A Monika, była okej

Po co budować dom, w którym nie zamieszka miłość
Po co przysiegi składac wciąż
Skoro nie można ich dotrzymać?
Tak właśnie jest z nami, czuję to w kościach
W zwykłym spojrzeniu, w braku zazdrości
Zgubiłem obraz, gdy wychodziłem
Z mojego domu. Kiedy to było?
Ref
To już koniec baby, skończyło się love story
Jestem już zmęczony, wracam dziś do żony
To już koniec baby, kłamiesz dla pieniędzy
Jestem już zmęczony, wracam dziś do żony
Pełne świątynie w krąg, a wszyscy grzeszą, kradną, cudzołożą
Pożegnać trzeba się
Skoro nie można płynąć jedną łodzią
Tak właśnie jest z nami, czuję to w kościach
W braku szacunku, w braku czułości
Wychodzę z domu, czuję, że żyję
Co się zdarzyło, kiedy to było?

Tańczyłaś boso
Byłaś jak natchniona
A po chwili zaczął padać deszcz

Nie wiedziałem
Co się ze mną dzieje
Wszystko znikło byłaś tylko ty
Stałaś w tęczy jak zaczarowana
Świeciło słonce a z nieba padał deszcz

Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść bez Ciebie
Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść by móc
Odnaleźć Ciebie tu (i wtedy padał deszcz)

Nasze oczy wreszcie się spotkały
Jak odbicia zagubionych gwiazd
Byłaś blisko, wszystko zrozumiałem
Kto odejdzie zawsze będzie sam

Uczyńmy z życia święto
By będąc tu przez chwilę
Wszystko zapamiętać
Nasza droga nigdy się nie skończy
A kto odejdzie zawsze będzie sam

Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść bez Ciebie
Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść by móc
Odnaleźć Ciebie tu (i wtedy padał deszcz 2x)

Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść bez Ciebie
Tyle samotnych dróg musiałem przejść by móc
Odnaleźć Ciebie tu

Every time of midnight
Every time we muddle again
Hold on lovely memories
Every sound you bring out
Every time we suffer again
Holding lovely memories
Every stand of no way
Every town we muddle again
Call, I hold your memory
Every game of no sense
Every shame we offer in game
Hold on lovely memory

Son of the blue sky
Son of the blue sky
Son of the blue sky
Son of the blue sky

Every timе of midnight
Every time we muddlе again
Call and hold flash memory
Every time of midnight
Every time of midnight
Call and hold flash memory

I'd rather say
Feeding some birds lost in a cage
Kicking one's heels having no way to go
Strolling musicians up on the way
Pulling one's leg, having no way to go
Feeding some birds lost in a cage there
Being so free, finding the way to be
Wondering how smart it happens to be, happens to be

Nic nie przychodzi do głowy
Samotny człowiek w środku dnia
Zupełnie sam na ulicy gwar
Zgubione szczęście
Nigdy nie wraca, choćbyś chciał
Tyle w życiu się zmienia
Zaufaj przeznaczeniu

Pijemy za lepszy czas
Za każdy dzień, który w życiu trwa
Za każde wspomnienie, co żyje w nas
Niech żyje jeszcze przez chwilę
Pijemy za lepszy czas
Za każdy dzień, który w życiu trwa
Za każde wspomnienie, co żyje w nas
Niech żyje jeszcze przez chwilę

Nic nie przychodzi do głowy
Nic nie poprawisz, choćbyś chciał
Czekaj na wiatr, zjawi się sam
Wykorzystaj tę chwilę
Może Cię spotkać w środku dnia
Nie trać wiary w marzenia
Tyle jest do stracenia

Yugopolis - Miasto budzi się

Poranek taki cichy, dzień powoli wstaje
Moje miasto budzi się
Słońce purpurą już okryło czarne dachy
W złoto zaraz zmieni je
Idę ulicą pustą, sławie co nad nami
Za tę ciszę, za ten świt
Że jesteś obok mnie, że nie poddałaś się
Za tę chwilę, która jest
Patrzę na moje miasto
Kocham je
Ty jeszcze śnij i wyśnij dla nas sen
Ref.:
Miasto budzi się
Z naszymi marzeniami
Szumem ulic woła mnie
Miasto budzi się
Nie jesteśmy sami
Daj nam dzisiaj dobry dzień, dobry dzień
Wieczorem gdy już cicho
Zamykamy oczy
W ciemną noc obejmę Cię
A potem tak jak zawsze
Ja przed słońcem wstanę, by powitać nowy dzień

Dezerter - Prawo do bycia idiotą

Może wystarczy narzekania
Że wszystko jest do dupy
Że bezmyślna konsumpcja
I niekończące się zakupy
Że narodowi katolicy
Szukają wszędzie spisku
I modlą się o klęskę
Żeby ich było na wierzchu
Może wystarczy narzekania
Że globalizacja i korporacje
Zabijają indywidualność
A władza zawsze ma rację
Że kontrola na każdym kroku
PIN-y, NIP-y i PESEL-e
Tajna policja skarbowa
Anonimowi donosiciele
Może wystarczy narzekania
Że pogrążamy się w bezładzie
Że środowisko zagrożone
A świat pędzi ku zagładzie
Że na wojnie w imię ropy
Giną niewinne osoby
A jedynym wygranym
Jest przemysł zbrojeniowy
Mamy wolność słowa
I wolność bycia sobą
Mamy prawo wyboru
I prawo do bycia idiotą

Dziś późno pójdę spać
Gdy wszyscy będą w łóżkach
Otwarte oczy mam
A głowa pełna i pusta
I nie wiem, o czym myśleć mam
Żeby mi się przyśnił taki świat
W którym się nie boję spać
W którym się nie boję spać

Już na mnie idzie tłum
I depcze wszystko po drodze
Nie mogę uciec mu
On też przed sobą nie może
Gwiazd już nie widać, no bo jak?
Kiedy łuna z ziemi bije tak
Jak gdyby chciała zalać świat
Jak gdyby chciała zalać świat

Choć nie chcę budzić się
Nie umiem spać

Przewróciło się niech leży
Cały luksus polega na tym
Że nie muszę go podnosić
Będę się potykał czasem
Będę się czasem potykał
Ale nie muszę sprzątać

Zapuściłem się to zdrowo
Coraz wyżej piętrzą się graty
Kiedyś wszystko poukładam
Teraz się położę na tym
To mi się wreszcie należy
Więc się położę na tym

Coś wylało się, nie szkodzi
Zanim stęchnie to długo jeszcze
Ja w tym czasie trochę pośpię
Tym bezruchem się napieszczę
Napieszczę się tym bezruchem
Potem otworzę okna

W kątach miejsce dla odpadków
Bo w te kąty nikt nie zagląda
Łatwiej tak i całkiem znośnie
Może czasem coś wyrośnie
Może ktoś zwróci uwagę
Ale kiedyś się wezmę

A przy nim gości tłum
Gospodarz zgięty w pół
Bije łychą w szklanę
"Cisza, chciałbym toast wznieść
Jak można to na cześć
Ojczyzny w której wieść
Przyszło życie nasze"

Racja, brachu, wypijmy za to
Kto z nami nie wypije, tego we dwa kije
Prawy do lewego, wypij, kolego
Przecież wiemy, nigdy nie ma tego złego

A na stole śledzik był
Zobaczył go pan Zbych
I pojął dobrze w mig
Że śledzik lubi pływać
Wstał, by nowy toast wznieść
Za rodzin świętą rzecz
No i teściowych też

"Dzisiaj młodzież już nie ta"

Lecz ręką machnął tak
Że wylał barszcz na panią

A toast wznosi ktoś
Za dobre wychowanie

Więc krawat ściągnał, bo

I choć był już na bani
Bez pomocy z gracją wstał
Jąkając się dał znak
By wypić teraz za

Nagła smutku kotwica, z niewidzialnego jachtu
Katedra ją złowiła w sklepienia sieć wysoką
Jak śmierć kamienna bryła jak wyrok naw prostokąt
Jaskółka błyskawica w kościele obumarłym
Tnie jak czarne nożyce lęk, który ją ogarnia
Jaskółka siostra burzy, żałoba fruwająca
Ponad głowami ludzi, w których się troska błąka
Jaskółka znak podniebny jak symbol nieuchwytna
Zwabiona w chłód katedry przestroga i modlitwa
Nie przetnie białej ciszy pod chmurą ołowianą
Lotu swego nie zniży nad łąki złotą plamą
Przeraża mnie ta chwila, która jej wolność skradła
Jaskółka czarny brylant wrzucony tu przez diabła
Na wieczne wirowanie na bezszelestną mękę
Na gniazda niezaznanie na przeklinanie piękna
Na gniazda niezaznanie na bezszelestną mękę

​happysad - W piwnicy u dziadka

Pamiętasz to miejsce w piwnicy u dziadka
Kiedy przychodziła jesień zrzucali tam węgiel i jabłka
I tam całowaliśmy się pierwszy raz
Brałem wtedy Twoje ręce
I kładłem je sobie na twarz
A skronie pulsowały gęściej
Gdy dłonie masowały lędźwia
No a na górze szalała burza
I wiatr z miejsca na miejsce przeganiał piach
Kałuże wypiły podwórze do cna
A buda ganiała psa
No gdzie było nam tak bezpiecznie jak tam
A kiedy przychodziła zima
I w mig w czarno-biały zmieniał się świat
Lizaliśmy paprocie na szybach
A mróz trzaskał jak bat
No a jeśli wychylaliśmy nosa
No to tylko na moment na staw
A coby rybom podać tlen
No ale póki jeszcze był dzień wracaliśmy pod dach
Bo gdzie było nam tak bezpiecznie jak tam
You might also likeA na wiosnę i letnie dni radosne
Biegliśmy co świt na sad
I tam zwykle chichraliśmy się w głos
Kiedy rosa łaskotała nas po stopach
Podsadzałem Cię wtedy na wiśnie
No i stamtąd strzelaliśmy do wron
A pestki to była nasza broń
A pestki to była nasza broń
A pestki to była nasza broń
Tak, pestki to była nasza broń
A dom to schron był nasz
No bo gdzie było nam tak bezpiecznie jak tam
A teraz, teraz to jest wojna
I dzień za dniem coraz bardziej kończy się świat
Kolejna armia bogobojna nie wiedzieć czemu upatrzyła sobie nas
Strzelają do nas jak do wron
Tyle że z ostrej broni i ze wszystkich stron
Kwiaty we włosach potargał wiatr
Jak smród po gaciach lata za nami strach
No a my, a my to się nie znamy już prawie
Czasem napiszesz coś zza oceanu
Jakieś myśli ledwie poukładane
Zrzucisz mi do skrzynki ze spamem
Ale któregoś pięknego dnia
Zaraz przed tym jak wszystko trafi szlag
Ja sięgnę do pamięci dna
No i stamtąd wyciągnę ten ślad
Bo gdzie było nam tak bezpiecznie jak tam
Bo gdzie było nam tak bezpiecznie jak tam

Kazik na Żywo - Artyści


Wszyscy artyści to prostytutki
W oparach lepszych fajek, w oparach wódki
To wszystko się tak cyklicznie powtarza
Czas nadziei, człowiek z żelaza
Wodzowi rewolucji do pasa się kłaniam
Mecenas daje złoto, mecenas wymaga
Ten system musi upaść, teraz i zaraz
Śpiewane na koncercie w koszarach

Czy Ty to widzisz?
Czy się nie wstydzisz?
Czy Ty to widzisz?
Czy się nie wstydzisz?

A słyszę, że mówią, że robią to co chcą
A słyszę, że mówią, że robią to co chcą
A słyszę, że mówią, że robią już to co chcą
A słyszę, że mówią, że robią już to co chcą

Wszyscy artyści to prostytutki
W oparach lepszych fajek, w oparach wódki
Trzecia Rzeczpospolita, Polska Ludowa
To samo od nowa, to samo od nowa
Przepraszam, czy mogę sobie zrobić zdjęcie z Panem
Ja i koleżanka, niedźwiedź, Zakopane
Swoją pracą na scenie chcę osiągnąć swój cel

Widziałem na żywo białego niedźwiedzia

Widziałem na żywo Dylana i Stonesów
Kilkanaście razy w swoim życiu, to wiem
Widziałem na żywo upadki i wzloty
Kosmiczne kobiety i kozaków na szkwał
Widziałem na żywo tak wielu idiotów
Choć wolałbym ich nawet nie znać online

Jesteś bliżej ognia, wiem, że tego chcesz
Płonę jak pochodnia, wszak to ludzka rzecz
Coraz bliżej ognia, wiem, że tego chcesz
Płonę jak pochodnia, wszak to ludzka rzecz

Widziałem na żywo ocean twych oczu
Sukienek kolory i róże ust
Widziałem na żywo oddechy twych szminek
Muzykę obcasów i skóry głód
Poczułem na żywo zazdrości mej atak
Napięciе godzin, samotność dat
Słyszałem na żywo poezję twych kłamstw
Poczułem na żywo zapachów smak

Niech słowa pięści zamienią w szum wody
Niech przyjdą noce szalonej miłości
Niech to co wzięte zostanie oddane
Niech to co inne zostanie pokochane
Niech miłość płonie w świetlistej koronie

Aborygen, Aborygen, niech tańczy na niebie
Aborygen, Aborygen, wolny jak ptak
Aborygen, Aborygen, niech tańczy na niebie
Niech tańczy na niebie

Są dla nas miejsca nieznane
Są takie chwile dla których się żyje
Niech to co wzięte zostanie oddane
Niech to co inne zostanie zrozumiane
I niech miłość płonie w świetlistej koronie

Marcelina - Karmelove

A gdybyś tu przy mnie dziś był
Chociaż wiatr już tuli mnie
I usiadłbyś na piasku gdzieś
Bo na trawie lubisz mniej
I całą noc do rana i w dzień
Opowiadałbyś mi
Co u Ciebie, a u mnie nie
Karmelowa skóra Twoja
Porysował czas ramiona
Ocieramy się o siebie
Razem ze mną
Obok mnie
A gdyby tak oszukać czas
Rutynowe rzucić szlak
Na balkonie spać
Gdy noc ciepła jest
I trzymaj mnie za rękę gdy śpię
Spać po prawej lubię mniej
A gdy będzie źle
Nie puść mnie
Karmelowa skóra Twoja
Porysował czas ramiona
Ocieramy się o siebie
Razem ze mną
Obok mnie

Brodka - Ten

Brak słów, brak nut, by opisać, co zrobiłeś mi
Nagle znikając bez „Do widzenia”
Znów chcesz, by dom twoim światem był
Skąd wiesz, że ja chcę z tobą w nim być?
Gdy zamknąłeś drzwi, zegar dalej bił
Czas nie stanął w miejscu, nie było mi żal
Zapomniałam już, czemu było źle
To już jest nieważne dziś dla mnie
Gdy zamknąłeś drzwi, zegar dalej bił
Czas nie stanął w miejscu, nie było mi żal
Zapomniałam już, czemu było źle
To już jest nieważne dziś dla mnie
Co chcesz, to mów
Nie potrzeba mi twych pustych słów
Bo nie jesteś tym, kim byłeś
Zbyt wiele kłamstw darowałam ci
Więc już zostań tam, gdzie chciałeś być
Gdy zamknąłeś drzwi, zegar dalej bił
Czas nie stanął w miejscu, nie było mi żal
Zapomniałam już, czemu było źle
To już jest nieważne dziś dla mnie

Złe kilometry dzielą nas
Lato umiera jesieni czas
W blaszany daszek tłucze deszcz
A w mojej głowie wciąż ktoś jest
Więc gdy wspomnienia męczą cię
Wracają myśli krótkie dnie
Zobaczyć jeszcze raz

Śnią się czarne oczy

Jamal (POL) - Policeman

 (x2)
Jak to policeman przeszukuje mnie?
Przecież mam prawo nosić to, co chcę
To, co moje jest moje, co jara mnie
W razie co nie wiem przecież jak i gdzie

To jest pieśń, tak ku wolności
Tej wolności, co chciałbyś ją mieć
A twe oczy ciągle w gotowości
Cały czas ktoś przeszkadza ci mieć
Marzenia, które są, które już tutaj były
To nie sąd, który prawo ci da
Ja jestem z tych, którzy dadzą ci siły
Mówimy - każdy jest wolny i tak
 (x2)
Jak to policeman przeszukuje mnie?
Przecież mam prawo nosić to, co chcę
To, co moje jest moje, co jara mnie
W razie co nie wiem przecież jak i gdzie

Wolni chcemy być, my tak chcemy żyć
Gdy przychodzisz na ten świat to nie masz nic
To twój szkic i ty go rysujesz
Człowiek, rozumiesz, ty losem swym kierujesz
Chcesz być wolny, czy chcesz być zakuty
Ślepą wiarą w nich, to są takie nuty
Które niosą ukojenie, wszystkim tym
Co dosięgło ich zwątpienie i przygniotło brzmię
Uwierz w swą wolność, to jest twoje mienie
To jest moje mienie wolnego człowieka
Prosto ze środka najszczerszy przekaz

I tylko wtedy, kiedy będziesz chciał
Cieszyć się tym, co ci dawno zabrano

Gdzie holenderskie specyfiki wyczulają smak
Spod ciężkich powiek obserwuję świat, gubię czas
Tak często ci go brak, jeszcze raz
To co moje jest moje, co jara mnie
Coś mnie tu trzyma i sprawia, że żyć się chce
Muzyką stawiam most na drugi brzeg
Na wszystko lek, notabene wielki mały człek
Nadszedł nowy wiek, by w trzecie tysiąclecie z rapem
Prawdą jest rap ten, nasz świat waszym światem
Dla ciebie wschodzi słońce więc wolność spijaj
Przez to się dowiesz jak smakuje przyjaźń
Bądź sobą, sens słowom daję serce
Bo zaufałem temu co gra skrzypce pierwsze
Po dziś dzień, uniwersalne wersy o dwóch takich
Co budowali mosty a palili schematy

Znikaj jak najprędzej

Dałam Ci wszystko (Dałam Ci wszystko)
Co mogłam dać (Co mogłam dać)
A w zamian za to Ty odpłacasz się tak

I choćbyś upadł na kolana
I choćbyś błagał
To już nie działa na mnie, żegnaj
Twoja strata
Zabieraj wszystkie swoje rzeczy
Nic tu po Tobie
Twój czas już minął, od dziś jestem
Twoim wrogiem, Ty moim wrogiem

Niesie mnie, gdzie ciebie, odnalazłam cię, odnalazłeś mnie...

Wielkomiejski szum, natłok wrażeń
Szukam znaku, który się okaże drogowskazem
Tym razem nie sięgam do książek, gazet
Mam przeczucie: muszę uciec w uczucie
Uciec światu, w którym wszystko jest jasne
A ludzie cierpią przez swoje aspiracje
Jedyne takie święte miejsce
Gdzie rozum przegrywa z duszą i sercem
A cały ten tercet wypowiada twoje imię
Poddałem się temu, jestem sam sobie winien
To minie, minie tak szybko, tak łatwo
Bo jesteś mą wiarą, nadzieją, zagadką
Której nie umiem objąć rozumem
Dlatego mam do niej taki szacunek
Może zwyczajnie brak mi taktu
Ale wierzę w Ciebie, moje sacrum

Chcę do jednego miejsca na ziemi
Gdzie problemy przestają mieć znaczenie
Do objęć, które akceptują me słabości
Do nich pragnę, tylko do mej miłości
Jest na ziemi jedno moje małe miejsce
Gdzie poza biciem serca nie liczy się nic więcej
Uciekam tam z moją całą miłością
Wierzę w ciebie, wierzę w moje sacrum

Chwile, gdy każdy problem to błahostka
Uciekam w moje świętości
Objęcia tych, którzy akceptują moje słabości
Rodzina, o której zawsze marzyłem
Dom, który był zawsze azylem
Miłość, to najpiękniejsze sacrum
Więc nie traktuj jej jak kontraktu
Który zrywasz, gdy dzień masz gorszy
Kiedy zyski chwilowo są mniejsze niż koszty
Sacrum je zmieni, lekki podmuch wiatru
To źródło, którego nikt nie może zatruć

Raz, dwa

Mam jedną pierdoloną schizofrenię
Zaburzenia emocjonalne, proszę puść to na antenie
Powiem ci, że to fakt – powiesz mi, że to obciach?
Pierdolę cię, i tak rozejdziesz się po łokciach
Bo ja jestem Bogiem, uświadom to sobie
Słyszysz słowa, od których włos jeży się na głowie
O rany, rany, jestem niepokonany
H-I-P-H-O-P bez reszty oddany
Przejebany, potencjał niewyczerpany
Chyba w DNA on był mi dany
Czekaj Fokus, Rah – jeszcze oszaleją wszystkie pizdy
Gdy poznają mój urok osobisty, duszę artysty
To jaki jestem skromny i bystry
Szczery do bólu, że aż przezroczysty
I wiesz, co mnie boli? Że w głowach się pierdoli
Zakłócony pokój ludziom dobrej woli!

Da przepływ momentalny, energii cios werbalny
Kandydat potencjalny na występ teatralny
Doznajesz szoku w 2000 roku – za to spalmy
Pora na elaborat eksperymentalny
W sposób niekonwencjonalny głoszę treści – słuchaj, proszę
Trafiam cię w punkt centralny, wiedz, że niepewności spłoszę
Nastroszę się, gniew boski jest nieobliczalny
Unoszę cię, bo z góry widok kapitalny
I idealny obraz, jak krajobraz tropikalny
Monstrualny krach – Rah nieprzewidywalny

Jestem Bogiem

I rzu-cam tym, a to jak kauczuk
Czysta technika, żadnego fałszu
Niuanse, sensacyjne seanse
W bezsensie sens jest jedynym awansem
Balansem w naturze, równowagi korekta
Unoszę się ponad to na specjalnych efektach
Cel – S-M-O-K na kartki biel
A-N-B-L-O-K E-J-B-L
L-l-lekko jak hel napełniam trwogą
I zapewniam, jak wrogom kontakt z podłogą
Twą dozgonną chęć dorównania swym bogom
Ogrom PFK podąża swą drogą
Przysięgam na ogon – uwierzysz, w co zechcę
A poczujesz jeszcze od tych lepsze dreszcze
Jestem Bogiem
Uświadom to sobie, sobie
Ty też jesteś Bogiem
Tylko wyobraź to sobie, sobie

Oooooo. Widzę, że pan się ładnie przedstawił przed... nam tutaj w tej chwili, słuchaczom, przed milionami słuchaczy

Przynieście dla mnie wina dzban
Potem ruszamy razem w tan!

Będzie! Będzie zabawa!
Będzie się działo!
I znowu nocy będzie mało
Będzie głośno, będzie radośnie
Znów przetańczymy razem całą noc

Orkiestra nie oszczędza sił
Już trochę im brakuje tchu
Polejcie wina również im
Znów na parkiecie będzie dym!
Bałkańskie rytmy, polska moc!
Znów przetańczymy całą noc!
I jeszcze jeden, malutki wina dzban
I znów ruszymy razem w tan!

Bracia - Parnassus

1 ContributorParnassus LyricsKręgi na wodzie
Jak w kszywym lustrze mój cień
Zmienia ciągle ksztaut
Chmury skłębione nad moją głową
Na raz wywracają świat
Drzewa koronami w dół
Ziemia sypie się do chmur
Powoli odrywam się
Jeśli to jest tylko sen
Proszę, niech nastanie dzień
Bo jestem tu całkiem sam
Rzeki spadają jak wodospady
A w nich płyną moje dni
Patrzę na wszystko, co dawno minęło
I wiem - nie mam teraz nic
Drzewa koronami w dół
Ziemia sypie się do chmur
Powoli odrywam się
Jeśli to jest tylko sen
Proszę, niech nastanie dzień
Bo jestem tu całkiem sam
Czas zatrzymał się
Wciąż tamten dzień
Przed oczami mam
Wróć zanim ten sen
Wkońcu się spełni
Drzewa koronami w dół
Ziemia sypie się do chmur
Powoli odrywam się
Jeśli to jest tylko sen
Spadam we wszystkich snach
Już nie chcę być tutaj sam
Nie mam już nic
W lustrze mój cień...You might also like

Mój sokole chmurnooki
Pytaj o mnie gór wysokich
Pytaj o mnie lasów mądrych
I uwolnij mnie

Mój sokole, mój przejrzysty
Pytaj o mnie nurtów bystrych
Pytaj o mnie kwiatów polnych
I uwolnij mnie, mój miły...

Jak mam pytać gwiazd w niebiosach?
Są zazdrosne o Twój posag:
O miłości cztery skrzynie
I o dobroć Twą

Mój miły...

Jak mam pytać innych kobiet?
Serce me odkryją w Tobie
I choć wiedzą, nie powiedzą
Nie odnajdę Cię

Snu już nie znam, step odmierzam
By odnaleźć Cię

Mój miły...

Jakże pytać mam księżyca?
On się kocha w Twych źrenicach
Słońce zgoni, step zasłoni
Nie odnajdę Cię

Mój miły...

Jakże pytać mam Kozaka?
Co na miłość chorą zapadł
On by z żalu świat podpalił
Gdyby stracił Cię...
Mnie...
Jakże pytać mam księżyca?
On się kocha w Twych źrenicach
Słońce zgoni, step zasłoni
Nie odnajdziesz mnie

My wpatrzeni, zasłuchani
Tak współcześni aż do granic
W ciemnym kinie, po kryjomu
Ocieramy łzę

Jestem spokojny
O sen...

Czwarta nad ranem
Może sen przyjdzie
Może mnie odwiedzisz
Czwarta nad ranem
Może sen przyjdzie
Może mnie odwiedzisz
Czemu cię nie ma na odległość ręki?
Czemu mówimy do siebie listami?
Gdy ci to śpiewam, u mnie pełnia lata
Gdy to usłyszysz, będzie środek zimy
Czemu się budzę o czwartej nad ranem
I włosy twoje próbuję ugłaskać?
Lecz nigdzie nie ma twoich włosów
Jest tylko blada nocna lampka
Łysa śpiewaczka
Śpiewamy bluesa, bo czwarta nad ranem
Tak cicho, żeby nie zbudzić sąsiadów
Czajnik z gwizdkiem świruje na gazie
Myślałby kto, że rodem z Manhattanu
Czwarta nad ranem
Może sen przyjdzie
Może mnie odwiedzisz

Jego trąbka jak księżyc
Biegnie nad topolą
Nigdzie się jej nie spieszy

Bywa, że nie jestem szczery
Czasem zwyczajnie kłamię
Jestem próżny, pazerny
Dbam tylko o swoje, cztery litery
Bywam małostkowy
Cyniczny i bezduszny
Osądzam bez litości
Bez serca i miłości
Chciałbym być zawsze niewinny i prawdziwy
Chciałbym być zawsze pełen wiary i nadziei

Łamię własne zasady

Me vibrato chciało dalej się wznieść
Ja nie pytam już i wiem o co chodzi mu
A w mej głowie luz

1 ContributorKuglarze Lyrics– Jest z tego pieniądz na przehulanie
Nie ma na dzieci, dom i ogródek
Jest wędrowanie, taniec i granie
Dla drżących panien, chciwych rozwódek
Jest opętanie
W pocie i ślinie, w cudacznej minie
Pełza iluzja od świata trwalsza
Wskrzesza popioły, płodzi opinie
Kiedy we wrzawie, wbrew rytmom marsza
Tańczę na linie…
Upijamy się po zajazdach
Kładziemy się spać z kim popadnie
O zrzuceniu marząc kostiumu
Ale muza, co mieszka w gwiazdach
Resztkę snu nad ranem ukradnie
I na łup nas wyda – tłumu
– Lęku nie przeżył, kto bać się pragnie
Miłość wysławia ten, kto nie kochał
Moc śmierci głosi człowiеcze jagnię
Nad niewinnością wampir zaszlocha
Nim jej dopadniе
Dlatego budzę podziw i trwogę
Na scenie z desek złożonych krzywo;
Czego nie mogą, bez trudu mogę
Kiedy dla sytych, pijących piwo
Połykam ogień…

Mrący na niby w syku pochodni

Jacek Kaczmarski - Wojna postu z karnawałem

Niecodzienne zbiegowisko na śródmiejskim rynku
W oknach, bramach i przy studni, w kościele i w szynku
Straganiarzy, zakonników, błaznów i karzełków
Roi się pstrokate mrowie, roi się wśród zgiełku
Praca stała się zabawą, a zabawa - pracą:
Toczą się po ziemi kości, z kart się sypią wióry
Nic nie znaczy, ten co nie gra, ci co grają - tracą
Ale nie odróżnić w ciżbie, który z nich jest który
W drzwiach świątyni na serwecie krzyże po trzy grosze
Rozgrzeszeni wysypują się bocznymi drzwiami
Klęczą jałmużnicy w prochu pomiędzy mnichami
Nie odróżnić, który święty, a który świętoszek
Oszalało miasto całe
Nie wie starzec ni wyrostek
Czy to post jest karnawałem
Czy karnawał - postem!
Dosiadł stulitrowej beczki kapral kawalarzy
Kałdun - tarczą, hełmem - rechot na rozlanej twarzy
Zatknął na swej kopii upieczony łeb prosięcia
Będzie żarcie, będzie picie, będzie łup do wzięcia
Przeciw niemu - tron drewniany zaprzężony w księży
A na tronie wychudzony tkwi apostoł postu
Już przeprasza Pana Boga za to, że zwycięży
A do ręki zamiast kopii wziął Piotrowe Wiosło

Oszalało miasto całe...
Siedzę w oknie, patrzę z góry, cały świat mam w oku
Widze co kto kradnie, gubi, czego szuka w tłoku
Zmierzchem pójdę do kościoła, wyspowiadam grzeszki
Nocą przejdę się po rynku i pozbieram resztki
Z nich karnawałowo-postną ucztą jak się patrzy
Uraduję bliski sercu ludek wasz żebraczy
Żeby w waszym towarzystwie pojąć prawdę całą:
Dusza moja - pragnie postu, ciało - karnawału!

W ognistych pierścieniach wysyłam w mgławice
Trwożliwych szelestów mysiego protestu
Przed życiem
Któremu na imię bezkresny jest przestwór
W spazmach i splotach najlichsza istota
Wypełnia swój los parabolą żywota
I gasnąc przepada wśród świateł miriadów –
Maskota
Potęgi, co Stwórcą nazywa się Ładu
Chaos nade mną i chaos pode mną
Dla wszystkich prócz mnie jest mozaiką tajemną
Ukrytych zamiarów, przeznaczeń i czarów
Gdy ciemność
Pochłania jednako i plebs i Cezarów
Widzę człowieka, jak cały w wypiekach
Powiada: nam mądrym się trzymać z daleka
Bo w czasach przejściowych kto przysiąc gotowy
Co czeka
Strażników wartości, cnót ponadczasowych?
Lub słyszę chłystka, co na to się ciska:
My mądrzy wszystkiemu przypatrzmy się z bliska;
Wszak w czasach chaosu zwykł żądać lud stosów
A iskra
Mądrości odmieni być może bieg losu

Dla nas jest tylko udziałowcem
Kantoru, który prosperuje;
Niech chroni nasze drzwi i okna
Od dżumy i religii obcej
Co każdy zysk dewaluuje
A będzie miał na swoją chwałę
Fundusze reprezentacyjne;
Pasterze Jego będą syci
Niech nam wybaczy grzechy małe
Za wielkie niechaj skruchę przyjmie
Bośmy bankierzy, a nie mnisi
W skrzyniach mamy skarpety
A w skarpetach monety
Co się mnożą w monetach oczu
Serca kusi ochota
By skorzystać ze złota
Lecz niech toczy się, niech innych toczy…
Jesteśmy wszak pośrednikami
Między zamiarem a stworzеniem
Umożliwiamy czyn podjęty;
Nie dziw, że się zabеzpieczamy
Bo czymże jest doczesne mienie
Jak nie nadzieją na procenty?

Inwestujący stale w niebyt –

On bankrutem jest boskim
Nie posiada ni wioski
Z której mógłby się czysto wyliczyć
Ale Jego agenci
Wiedzą jak się świat kręci
I jak wszystko zapłacić – niczym
Oby na zawsze miejsce znaleźć
Pomiędzy wiarą a rozumem
Między ideą a towarem;
Bezpieczne to nie bywa wcale
W interes włożyć myśl i dumę
By zamiast zysku – ponieść karę
Dlatego mamy dwa oblicza:
Metali chłód, krwi żywej trwogę
(Chaosu Jego weksle – w skrzyni)
I to jest cała tajemnica:
Szczęśliwi – nie szukamy Boga
Lecz wiemy, co On nam jest winien
Już Go mamy! Sakralny
Ale niewypłacalny!
Kryzys pożarł gwarancję i sumę!
A On zsyła anioła
I śmiertelny pot z czoła
Wycieramy
Jak błędny rachunek…

Wokół wszyscy na wyścigi się bogacą
Są i tacy, którym płacą nie wiem za co
Ale cieszą się szacunkiem i urzędem
Bo czas możliwości wszelakich ostatnio nam nastał…
Mogę włóczyć się i żyć z czego popadnie
Mogę okraść kantor, kościół czy przekupkę
Żyć z nierządu albo doić chętną wdówkę
Paradować syty i ubrany ładnie –
A chyłkiem, jak złodziej o zmroku wymykam się z miasta…
Mogłem uczyć się na księdza lub piekarza
(Duch i ciało zawsze potrzebują strawy)
Na wojaka mogłem iść i zażyć sławy
Co wynosi i przyciąga – bo przeraża
A młodość to ponoć przygoda, a wojsko to szkoła…
Mogłem włączyć się do bandy rzezimieszków
Niepodzielnie rządzić lasem lub rozstajem
Zostać mnichem i dalekie zwiedzać kraje
Rozgrzeszając niespokojne dusze z grzeszków

Co goni mnie z miejsca na miejsce o głodzie i chłodzie…
Ludzie, których widzę – stoją do mnie tyłem:
Ten pod bramą leje, ów na pannę czeka
Nawet pies znajomy na mój widok szczeka…
Sam się z życia nader sprawnie obrobiłem
Więc chyłkiem powracam do domu o zmroku – jak złodziej
Jakaś ciepła mnie otacza cisza wokół
Padam z nóg i czuję ręce na ramionach
Do nóg czyichś schylam głowę, jak pod topór

Lecz panika – nie wiem skąd wiem – jest już dla mnie skończona

Jacek Kaczmarski - Cromwell

Idą na Londyn! Idą purytanie!
Siłą ich czystość czyli lęk przed grzechem
Lęk rodzi wściekłość, a wściekłość – powstanie;
Idą pokonać chrześcijan – chrześcijanie
Mgłą dysząc zamiast oddechem
Broni się grzeszny król i pomazaniec
Nie tyle władzy żal mu, co zasady
Żal płynie z winy, a z winy – kajanie
Lecz nie kajania pragną purytanie:
Muszą dowody mieć – zdrady
Dowodem – zdrada. Ów zdrajca zdradzony
Przez własne siły (te, na które liczył)
Nie może przecież zachować korony
Skoro przez Boga został osądzony
I sądzą go jego stronnicy
Jak zwykle chaos jest przy tym i zamęt
Ulica prawdę waży i rozdziela
O swoją przyszłość troszczy się parlament
Skazaniec łzawy szkicuje testament –
Z myślą o losie Cromwella
Turla się głowa królewska pod stopy
Sprawiedliwości stało się więc zadość
Dla zniewolonej wzór to Europy:
Szafot wszak w końcu biskup sam pokropił
I wielka nastała radość!

I pod stołem decydować o rozgrywce
Nie drgnij kiedy król, którego w ręku masz – twą weźmie damę –
Szuler ten, kto pierwszy nazwie się szczęśliwcem
Niе ciesz się, gdy go odkryjesz; zwykle bywa trzеch lub czterech –
Siadłeś po to tu, by zagrać uczciwego
Swoje zapasowe asy trzymaj długo blisko nerek
Póki nie zostanie ci już nic innego
Wtedy dołącz je do talii tak, by nikt nie spostrzegł sprawcy
A gdy już się wyda, że jest kart za dużo
Wstań od stołu z oburzeniem, walnij pięścią – Ha! Szubrawcy!
A więc temu to rozrywki wasze służą!
Unieważniam wszystkie partie! Pieczętuję stół i pulę!
Albo wzywam straż! I skandal! I rozróba!
Łotry znikną – ty usiądziesz, przetasujesz talię czule
I zaprosisz – kogo chcesz – by go oskubaćYou might also like

1 ContributorBajka średniowieczna LyricsNędza pustoszy strychy i komory
Złoto skupuje nadwyżki natury
Tylko bogaty żyje – albo chory;
I nie odróżnisz, który z nich jest który
Gdy spod ich tłustych stołów, pustych koryt
Wyłażą szczury
Brzydzą się nimi ci, co żywi jeszcze
Ze wstrętem nogi podnosząc do góry
Bezkarność dając małym posłom nieszczęść
Co mają tylko jeden cel ponury:
Zagarnąć resztki. Bowiem właśnie w resztce
Mnożą się szczury
Cóż, że się z sobą żrą niezmordowanie
By własnym braciom dobrać się do skóry:
Z tej bitwy nic już nam nie pozostanie
Na mokrych wiórach zwapniałe marmury
Z których miał powstać Kościół Pojednania –
Zostaną szczury
Zabrakło grajka, co by grą czarował
Zwiódł najazd szczurzy melodią na temat
Jest pisk i szelest, krzyki są i słowa
Włosy z głów rwane rękami obiema
Gniewne modlitwy, żeby żyć od nowa…
– Muzyki nie ma

Przemysław Gintrowski - Ja


Nie jestem piękny, a przyciągam wzrok
Cieszy mnie wstręt w tworzących mnie spojrzeniach;
Sprytu nauczył mnie ułomny krok
Co krok normalny w powód wstydu zmienia
Wiem, że nawiedzam przyzwoite sny;
Bóg mnie spartaczył, jam wyrzut sumienia;
Dlatego wpełzam w dostojne zgromadzenia
Gdzie racją bytu jest bezkarne – my!

A ja na złość im – nie należę
I tak beze mnie – o mnie – gra
Jednego nikt mi nie odbierze:
Ja jestem ja, ja, ja. 

W karczmie tak siadam, by mnie widzieć mógł
Każdy obżartuch najzdrowszy i pijak;
To, co mi Bóg dał zamiast zwykłych nóg
Wokół półmiska bezwstydnie owijam
Tym, co mam w miejsce rąk, odpędzam psy
Węszące łatwy łup w chromego strawie
I traci nastrój biesiadników gawiedź
Co śpiewa przy mnie swoje śmieszne – my!

Swój tors niezwykły wystawiam na pokaz:
Pomnik wyjątku, drżę z rozkoszy, że
Żadnego z radnych nie przepuszczę oka
Gdy się dębowe już zatrzasną drzwi
By przebieg obrad skryć przed losem plebsu
Wiem, że zdołałem trochę nastrój zepsuć
Tym, co tak godnie mówią, myśląc – my!

Bo ja na złość im – nie należę
I tak beze mnie – o mnie – gra
Jednego nikt mi nie odbierze:
Ja jestem ja, ja, ja

W farze na najświetlistszą włażę z ław
Gdzie przed ołtarzem tęcza lśni z witraży
By, kiedy wierni proszą – Boże zbaw! –
Móc Mu pokazać, co z mej zrobił twarzy
Więc patrzą na mnie, chociaż kapłan grzmi
Żeśmy jedynie niepoprawnym stadem
Bom namacalnym przecież jest przykładem
Że jest nieprawdą ich chóralne – my!
Bo ja na złość im – nie należę
I tak beze mnie – o mnie – gra
Jednego nikt mi nie odbierze:
Ja jestem ja, ja, ja

Nie jestem sam. Odmiennych nas jest w bród!
Wciąż otorbionych wstrętem i respektem
Bóg dał z kalectwem pokusę nam – i głód
By się związać w pokręconych sektę
Partia Potworków! Rząd zatrutej krwi!
Ach, cóż za ulga – unormalnić skazy!
Nakaz szacunku, a nie gest odrazy
Wystarczy – ja! ja! ja! – zmienić w – my!

Nie, nie chcę wpływać i należeć!
I tak beze mnie – o mnie – gra
Jednego nikt mi nie odbierze:
Ja jestem ja! ja! ja!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Marcin Luter

W zamku Wartburg, na stromym urwisku
(Te niemieckie przepaście i szczyty)
Wbrew mej woli, a gwoli ucisku
Wyniesiony pod boskie błękity
Pismo święte z wszechwładnej łaciny
Na swój własny język przekładam:
Ożywają po wiekach
Dawne cuda i czyny
Matką Ewa znów, Ojcem znów – Adam
Bliźnim jest mi tragiczny Abraham
Gdy poświęcić ma syna w ofierze;
Widzę ogień na Sodomy dachach
Gdzie zwęglają się grzeszni w niewierze
Bezmiar winy i kary surowość
Brzmią prawdziwie w mym szorstkim języku
Na początku jest słowo
I okrutnie brzmi słowo
Ale spójrz wokół siebie, krytyku!
Grzechy Rzym za gotówkę odpuszcza
Lecz w wojennej się nurza rozkoszy
Papież w zbroi, w ubóstwie tkwi tłuszcza
Z której groszy katedry się wznosi
W nawach katedr transakcje wszeteczne
Ksiądz spowiednik rozgrzesza za bilon
Tak jest, było i będzie
Zło i dobro jest wieczne
Lecz nie może być wieczny Babilon

Lecz szukajcie miast, które on spalił!
Ja na wrotach kościelnych
Tezy swoje przybiłem
On mnie wyklął, a mnisi śpiewali
Słowa palą, więc pali się słowa:
Nikt o treści popiołów nie pyta
Ale moja ze Stwórcą rozmowa
Jak Syn Jego – do drzewa przybita!
Niech się gorszy prałacia elita
Niech się w mękach świat tworzy od nowa!
Lecz niech czyta, kto umie
Niech nauczy się czytać!
Niech powraca – do Słowa!

1 ContributorWłóczędzy LyricsWchodzimy z twarzami zdrowymi od mrozu
Siadamy przy ogniu tańczącym z radości
Ścieramy z nadgarstków odciski powrozów
Wołamy o wino i chleb, i tłustości
Spod ścian patrzą na nas w milczeniu miejscowi
Napięci, na wszystko gotowi
Wchłaniamy łapczywie wielkimi kęsami
Łykamy alkohol aż warczy nam w grdykach
Bekniemy czasami, pierdniemy czasami
Aż z ław w ciepło wzbija się woń wędrownika
I płynie pod ściany miejscowych jak ręka
Co mówi – przestańcie się lękać
Śpiewamy piosenki o drodze i pracy
O braku pieniędzy i braku miłości
Podnoszą się ze snu miejscowi pijacy
Słuchają oczami rozumnej przeszłości
Ktoś wstanie, podejdzie, zapyta – kto my?
– My dzieci wolności, bezdomne my psy
Przysiądą się stawiać i pytać nieśmiało
Gdzie dobrze, gdzie lepiej, a gdzie pieniądz rośnie?
I plączą się cienie pod niską powałą
I coraz jest ciaśniej i duszniеj, i głośniej

I dziewki przysiądą się też, ośmielone
Do ognia dorzuci przebiegły gospodarz:
Noc długa korzyści mu doda
Rozgrzani, snujemy niezwykłą opowieść
Zazdroszcząc im tego, że tacy ciekawi
Choć mają, co każdy tak chciałby mieć człowiek
A za – byle co – już gotowi zastawić
By włóczyć się, szukać i błądzić jak my
I żyć bez pór roku, bez nocy i dni
Pijemy i każdy już ma coś na oku –
Ten nocleg w piekarni, ten pannę piersiastą
Świt znajdzie nas znowu za miastem na stoku
Gdzie nikt tak naprawdę nic nie ma na własność
A wam pozostanie piosenka i sny:
„My dzieci wolności, bezdomne my psy…”

1 ContributorSiedem grzechów głównych LyricsWielkich upadków więcej widzieliśmy niż wzlotów
Byliśmy oczywiście na uczcie Baltazara
Uczyliśmy się mowy zwycięskich Wizygotów
Na służbie ostatniego przepiwszy żołd Cezara
Przeżyliśmy Rolanda, by świadczyć śmierć Karola
Pozostałościom mocarstw nie oczekiwać łaski
Razem z Ludwikiem Świętym widząc się w aureolach
Wyrzygiwaliśmy krew w jerozolimskie piaski
Co było wszechpotężne – zdaje się niedorzeczne
Gdzie słodka woń Arabii? Gdzie tajemniczy Syjam?
Religie tysiącletnie też nie są dla nas wieczne
I demokracja kwitnie, dojrzewa i przemija…
A nas wiedzie siedem demonów, co nami się karmią:
Na przedzie pycha podąża z tańczącą latarnią
Chciwość wczepiła się w siodło i grzebie po sakwach
Broi pod zbroją lubieżność, pokusa niełatwa
Bandzioch domaga się płynów i straw do przesytu
Wabi rozkoszne lenistwo do łóż z aksamitu
Gniew zrywa ze snu i groźbą na oślep wywija
A zazdrość nie wie, co sen i po cichu zabija
Tak zbrojni w moce, na które nie ma lekarstwa
Stawiamy nadal i obalamy mocarstwa

Którymi dzisiaj rządzi chwast, kamień lub jaszczurka
Wierzchowiec się potyka, bo ciąży mu kulbaka
I jeździec w pełnej zbroi błądzący po pagórkach
Jesteśmy jak zwierzęta – z rytmami śmierci zżyte
Choć człowiek w nas – do Nowej wciąż prze Jerozolimy;
Więc nastawiamy ucha na echa nowych bitew
Bo wiemy, że na pewno je w końcu usłyszymy…

Wciąż tylko o stosach i grobach;
Pan wiesza, poddaje torturom
Głos pana to wieczna żałoba
Że trwają – pan za złe ma murom
A mnie się to życie podoba!
– Proszę pani, ja życie lubię
W jego prawdzie i w jego złudzie;
Ale człowiek dąży ku zgubie
Wiedzieć o tym nie chcą ludzie
– Właśnie, ludzie. Niech pan pomyśli
Starczy im prawdziwych przepaści
A najgorsze – jeszcze się przyśni;
W cierpieniu – wszyscy są właśni
Pan mówi, że życie to czyściec
A oni pragnęliby baśni
– Proszę pani, przecież to robię
Opowiadam baśnie, choć smutne –
Kim by był niepojęty człowiek
Bez braci Grimm prawdy okrutnej?
– Właśnie, prawda. O co pan pyta?
Obcy panu brak wątpliwości
To pan śpiewa, co pan przeczytał:
Po prostu świat w książkę uprościł
Pan gra, kiedy wszechświat zgrzyta
Pan przeczy człowieczej miłości!

Ale mówi, że wciąż Go szuka
W pańskich trwogach można się zgubić;

Na nauki, tezy i wnioski –
Jestem egzemplarz człowieka

I wtedy szczeka pies na ostróg moich brzęk
Ze ściany rezonuje mu gitary dźwięk...
Ze wspomnień pieśni, które znam, tka wątek wróżb
Jak gdybym kiedyś swoje życie przeżył już...
Na drzwi się nie oglądaj, nasienie sobacze
Gdzie w śniegach nocny wilka trop i zaspy po pas
Skacz, jak ci każę, będę patrzył jak skaczesz!
Encore, encore, jeszcze raz!
Więc jem i śpię, pies śledzi wszystkie moje ruchy
Gdy piję, powiem czasem coś, on wtedy słucha
I widzę w oknie, zamiast zimy, lampę, psa
I oficera, który pije tak jak ja!
Nic nie ma za tą ścianą z wielkich, ciemnych belek
Nad stropem nazbyt niskim, by skorzystać z szelek!
Nic we mnie, prócz do świata żalu dziecięcego
Tu nikt nie widzi, więc się wstydzić nie mam czego!
Oczami za mną nie wódź, nasienie sobacze!
Gdy piję w towarzystwie alkoholowych zmor!
I nie liż mnie po rękach, gdy biję cię i - płaczę!
Jeszcze raz! Jeszcze raz! Encore!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Nasza klasa

Co się stało z naszą klasą, pyta Adam w Telawiwie
Ciężko sprostać takim czasom, ciężko w ogóle żyć uczciwie
Co się stało z naszą klasą, Wojtek w Szwecji w porno klubie
Pisze dobrze mi tu płacą, za to co i tak wszak lubię
Kaśka z Piotrkiem są w Kanadzie, bo tam mają perspektywy
Staszek w Stanach sobie radzi, Paweł do Paryża przywykł
Gośka z Przemkiem ledwie przędą, w maju będzie trzeci bachor
Próżno skarżą się urzędom, że też chcieliby na Zachód
Za to Magda jest w Madrycie i wychodzi za Hiszpana
Maciek w grudniu stracił życie, gdy chodzili po mieszkaniach
Janusz, ten co zawiść budził, że go każda fala niesie
Jest chirurgiem, leczy ludzi, ale brat mu się powiesił
Marek siedzi za odmowę, bo nie strzelał do Michała
A ja piszę ich historię - i to już jest klasa cała
Jeszcze Filip, fizyk w Moskwie, dziś nagrody różne zbiera
Jeździ kiedy chce do Polski, był przyjęty przez premiera
Odnalazłem klasę całą, na wygnaniu, w kraju, w grobie
Ale coś się pozmieniało, każdy sobie żywot skrobie
Odnalazłem całą klasę, wyrośniętą i dojrzałą
Rozdrapałem młodość naszą, lecz za bardzo nie bolało
Już nie chłopcy lecz mężczyźni, już kobiety nie dziewczyny
Młodość szybko się zabliźni, nie ma w tym niczyjej winy
Wszyscy są odpowiedzialni, wszyscy mają w życiu cele
Wszyscy w miarę są normalni, ale przecież to nie wiele
You might also likeNie wiem sam co mi się marzy, jaka z gwiazd nade mną świeci
Gdy wśród tych nieobcych twarzy, szukam ciągle twarzy dzieci
Czemu wciąż przez ramię zerkam, choć nie woła nikt kolego
Że ktoś ze mną zagra w berka, lub przynajmniej w chowanego
Własne pędy własne liście, zapuszczamy każdy sobie
I korzenie oczywiście, na wygnaniu, w kraju, w grobie
W dół, na boki, wzwyż ku słońcu, na stracenie w prawo w lewo
Kto pamięta, że to w końcu, jedno I to samo drzewo

Jacek Kaczmarski - Obława

Skulony w jakiejś ciemnej jamie smaczniem sobie spał
I spały wilczki dwa, zupełnie ślepe jeszcze
Wtem stary wilk przewodnik, co życie dobrze znał
Łeb podniósł, warknął groźnie, aż mną szarpnęły dreszcze
Poczułem wokół siebie nienawistną woń
Woń, która burzy wszelki spokój, zrywa wszystkie sny
Z daleka ktoś, gdzieś krzyknął krótki rozkaz: goń!
I z czterech stron wypadły na nas cztery gończe psy!
Obława, obława na młode wilki obława
Te dzikie zapalczywe, w gęstym lesie wychowane
Krąg śniegu wydeptany, w tym kręgu plama krwawa
I ciała wilcze kłami gończych psów szarpane!
Ten, który na mnie rzucił się, niewiele szczęścia miał
Bo wpadł prosto mi na kły i krew trysnęła z rany
Gdym teraz ile w łapach sił przed siebie prosto gnał
Ujrzałem młode wilczki na strzępy rozszarpane
Zginęły ślepe ufne tak, puszyste kłębki dwa
Bezradne na tym świecie złym nie wiedząc, kto je zdławił
I zginie wilk-przewodnik, choć życie dobrze zna
Bo z trzema na raz walczy psami i z ran trzech naraz krwawi
Obława, obława...
You might also likeWypadłem na otwartą przestrzeń pianą z pyska tocząc
Lecz tutaj też ze wszystkich stron zła mnie otacza woń
A myśliwemu, co mnie dojrzał, już się śmieją oczy
I ręka pewna niezawodna podnosi w górę broń
Rzucam się w bok, na oślep gnam, aż ziemia spod łap pryska
I wtedy pada pierwszy strzał, co kark mi rozszarpuje
Pędzę, słyszę jak on klnie, krew mi płynie z pyska
On strzela po raz drugi, lecz teraz już pudłuje
Obława, obława ...
Wyrwałem się z obławy tej, schowałem w jakiś las
Lecz ile szczęścia miałem w tym to każdy chyba przyzna
Leżałem w śniegu jak nieżywy długi, długi czas
Po strzale zaś na zawsze mi została krwawa blizna
Lecz nie skończyła się obława i nie śpią gończe psy
I giną ciągle wilki młode na całym wielkim świecie
Nie dajcie z siebie zedrzeć skór, brońcie się i wy
O, bracia wilcy! Brońcie się nim wszyscy wyginiecie
Obława, obława...

Przemysław Gintrowski - A my nie chcemy uciekać stąd

Stanął w ogniu nasz wielki dom
Dym w korytarzach kręci sznury
Jest głęboka, naprawdę czarna noc
Z piwnic płonące uciekają szczury
Krzyczę przez okno czoło w szybę wgniatam
Haustem powietrza robię w żarze wyłom
Ten co mnie słyszy ma mnie za wariata
Woła - co jeszcze świrze ci się śniło
Więc chwytam kraty rozgrzane do białości
Twarz swoją widzę, twarz w przekleństwach
A obok sąsiad patrzy z ciekawością
Jak płonie na nim kaftan bezpieczeństwa
Dym w dziurce od klucza a drzwi bez klamek
Pękają tynki wzdłuż spoconej ściany
Wsuwam swój język w rozpalony zamek
Śmieje się za mną ktoś jak obłąkany
Lecz większość śpi nadal, przez sen się uśmiecha
A kto się zbudzi nie wierzy w przebudzenie
Krzyk w wytłumionych salach nie zna ech
Na rusztach łóżek milczy przerażenie
Ci przywiązani dymem materaców
Przepowiadają życia swego słowa
Nam pod nogami żarzą się posadzki
Deszcz iskier czerwonych osiada na głowach
Dym coraz gęstszy, obcy ktoś się wdziera
A my wciśnięci w najdalszy sali kąt
"Tędy!" - wrzeszczy - "Niech was jasna cholera!"
A my nie chcemy uciekać stąd.
A my nie chcemy uciekać stąd!
Krzyczymy w szale wściekłości i pokory
Stanął w ogniu nasz wielki dom!
Dom dla psychicznie i nerwowo chorych!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Limeryki o narodach

Był Anglik, co przyjaźń nawiązał z Hindusem
Z najczystszej sympatii, a nie pod przymusem
Do dzisiaj by trwała
Ta przyjaźń wspaniała
Lecz Hindus nieświeży dał mu ser
Pretensje mieć trudno do tego Anglika
Gdy druh w narodowej go dumie dotyka
Więc wzgardził pariasem
I przyjaźń swą z czasem
Położył u stóp – Irlandczyka

Raz Francuz sąsiada miał, co był z Somalii
W Tuluzie mieszkali i pastis pijali
Lecz wnet się przekonał
Potomek Dantona
Że druh jego łeb ma ze stali
Nie mieli pretensji koledzy Francuza
Że przepić nie umiał czarnego łobuza
Lecz rzekli: Mon ami

Przemysław Gintrowski - Karol Levittoux

Zbrodniczy spisek w gimnazjalnej klasie
Zagraża państwu, w jego spokój godzi
Inspiratorów wkrótce wykryć da się
Wciąż niepoprawni Polaczkowie młodzi
Ten Levittoux był hersztem, jak się zdaje
Przez niego w dusze sączy się trucizna
Śledztwo prowadźcie zgodnie ze zwyczajem
W mig się przyzna, prędko się przyzna
Drogi panie Levittoux, prawdę wyznać chciej
Gdy wspólników podasz tu, sercu będzie lżej
Milczysz, panie Levittoux, nie unikniesz kar
Młodzież wiodłeś ty ku złu, smuci się nasz car
Mury kazamat dostatecznie grube
Żeby krzyk każdy wytłumić dokładnie
Błogosławiony, kto przejdzie tę próbę
A kto się złamie, przekleństwo nań spadniе
Logika dziejów nakłada kajdany
Sprawiedliwości zgrzytają zasuwy
I ciągle jеdna myśl tłucze o ścianę:
"Nic nie mówić, nie mówić, nie mówić..."
Wszakże, panie Levittoux, nie działałeś sam
Gdy cię pozbawimy snu, wszystko powiesz nam
Miejże rozum Levittoux, próżny jest twój trud
Żadnej strawy nie dać mu, by go złamał głód
Na przesłuchaniu wziął czterysta pałek
Konieczny był tu bezpośredni przymus
Śledztwo da skutek, jeśli jest wytrwałe
Bez końca przecież nie może się trzymać
Zwinięty w szmatę leży sztandar ciała
Szarpie go w strzępy ptaszysko dwugłowe
Krwią pokreślona pleców karta biała
Na niej napis "nie powiem, nie powiem..."
W końcu z ciebie, Levittoux, tryśnie zeznań zdrój
Zaznasz knuta dzień po dniu, pęknie upór twój
Chciałeś uciec, Levittoux, coś ci słabo szło
Krzycz do ostatniego tchu, nas nie wzruszy to
Pod siennikiem migoce kaganek
Mniej boli ogień, niźli ran płomienie
Dziś sobie takie rozścielę posłanie
Co moją celę w jeden krzyk zamieni
Skąpo tu światła Moskale mi dali
Ale wystarczy, żeby spłonął człowiek
Patrzcie, jak długo ten więzień się pali
Co już nic nie powie, nie powie...
Zwęglone resztki wymieciono rano
Ból szybko wsiąka w kamień cytadeli
Po incydencie tym rozkaz wydano
By więźniom światła nie dawać do celiYou might also like

1 ContributorEpitafium dla Sergiusza Jesienina LyricsWściekła się wielka niedźwiedzica
I lecą z pyska płaty piany
Samotny szczeniak do księżyca
Zanosi jazgot obłąkany
Po mlecznej drodze wóz się toczy
Turkocze za nim piąte koło
Sponad zodiaku o północy
Ze mną ptak ryba i dziwoląg
I Ruś cerkiewna Ruś dawnej wiary
Szumi pomoriem w riazańskiej duszy
Huczy po karczmach krwawym pożarem
I Twoje brzozy pali Sergiuszu
Brzozo wędrowna czemu się śnisz
I tak cię zrąbią dla mnie na krzyż
Chato rodzinna płyń tam gdzie kres
Niech się dzwoneczek śmieje do łez
Ryczy lew ranny ponad głową
Bliźnięta płyną rzeką modrą
Byk galopuje łąką płową
I pręży się na wadze skorpion
Tętni przez łąki koziorożec
Strzelec go tropi nieustannie
I płynie wodnik po jeziorzе
Po utopionej płacze pannie
I Ruś jak panna niеch płacze po nim
Święta Łagoda zejdzie do ziemi
Na bruku Moskwy klon oszroniony
Biblijny prorok Sergiusz Jesienin
Riazańska matko skąd w oczach łzy
Karczemne szczęście samogon dym
Moskwo karczemna płyń za mną płyń
Pokochał zodiak riazański syn
Otwórzcie mi stróże anieli
Błękitne podwoje dni
O północy anioł w bieli
Z moim wiernym koniem znikł
Koń mój Bogu niepotrzebny
Koń mój siła ma i moc
Słyszę gryzie łańcuch srebrny
Rży żałośnie w głuchą noc
Widzę pędzi wśród zamieci
Targa gniewnie gruby sznur
Jak z miesiąca z niego leci
Sierść bułana w kłęby chmur
Tutaj Jesienin w najśmieszniejszej z gier
Wybiegał w błękit zza karczemnej Moskwy
Riazańską łąką zakwitł w Angleterre
Sen pożegnalny ostatni oktostych
Pomódl się pomódl za Jesienina
Przeżegnaj wszystkie dalekie drogi
Wychyl wieczorem czareczkę wina
Ostatnie grosze rozdaj ubogim
Nie pragnął krzyku odpoczynek snił
W sekundzie się przeżywał od nowa
A potem długo waliła do drzwi
Zniecierpliwiona służba hotelowa
Podróżną sakwę zarzuć na ramię
Wyjdź na gościniec do bramy nieba
Słyszysz jak tętni przez śnieżną zamieć
Księżyc na nowiu bułany źrebak
Weszli krzyknęli a jeden się bał
Bo spoza okien milczące niebiosa
A tam na stole gdzie Jesienin stał
Snuł się powoli dymek z papierosa
Słyszysz jak woła każdego ranka
Wiatr myszkujący po połoninach
Leci w dal z wiatrem rżenie bułanka
Pomódl się pomódl za Jesienina

On natchniony i młody był, ich nie policzyłby nikt
On im dodawał pieśnią sił, śpiewał że blisko już świt
Świec tysiące palili mu, znad głów podnosił się dym
Śpiewał, że czas by runął mur
Oni śpiewali wraz z nim:

Wyrwij murom zęby krat!
Zerwij kajdany, połam bat!
A mury runą, runą, runą
I pogrzebią stary świat!
Wyrwij murom zęby krat!
Zerwij kajdany, połam bat!
A mury runą, runą, runą
I pogrzebią stary świat!

Wkrótce na pamięć znali pieśń i sama melodia bez słów
Niosła ze sobą starą treść, dreszcze na wskroś serc i głów
Śpiewali więc, klaskali w rytm, jak wystrzał poklask ich brzmiał
I ciążył łańcuch, zwlekał świt
On wciąż śpiewał i grał:

A śpiewak także był sam

Łańcuch kołysał się u nóg
Patrzy na równy tłumów marsz
Milczy wsłuchany w kroków huk
A mury rosną, rosną, rosną
Łańcuch kołysze się u nóg

Jak nowa - rezydencja carów
Służba swe obowiązki zna
Precz wysiedlono stąd Tatarów
Gdzie na świat wyrok zapaść ma
Okna już widzą, słyszą ściany
Jak kaszle nad cygarem Lew

Co robi Góral w krymską noc
Gdy gestem w wiernych towarzyszy
Wpaja swą legendarną moc
Nie miejcie żalu do Stalina
Nie on się za tym wszystkim krył
To w końcu nie jest jego wina
Że Roosevelt w Jałcie nie miał sił
Gdy się Triumwirat wspólnie brał
Za świata historyczne kształty
Wiadomo, kto Cezara grał

Nie miejcie żalu do Churchilla
Nie on wszak za tym wszystkim stał
Wszak po to tylko był Triumwirat
By Stalin dostał to, co chciał
Komu zależy na pokoju
Ten zawsze cofnie się przed gwałtem
Wygra, kto się nie boi wojen
I tak rozumieć trzeba Jałtę
Ściana pałacu słuch napina
Gdy mówi do Kaleki Lew
Ja wierzę w szczerość słów Stalina
Dba chyba o radziecką krew
I potakuje mu Kaleka
Niezłomny demokracji stróż:
Stalin to ktoś na miarę wieku!
Oto mąż stanu, oto wódz!
Bo sojusz wielkich - to nie zmowa
To przyszłość świata - wolność, ład!
Przy nim i słaby się uchowa
I swoją część otrzyma - strat
Nie miejcie żalu do Roosevelta
Pomyślcie, ile musiał znieść
Fajka, dym cygar i butelka
Churchill, co miał sojusze gdzieś!
Wszakże radziły trzy Imperia
Nad granicami, co zatarte
W szczegółach zaś już siedział Beria
I tak rozumieć trzeba Jałtę
Więc delegacje odleciały
Ucichł na Krymie carski gród
Gdy na zachodzie działa grzmiały
Transporty ludzi szły na wschód
Świat wolny święcił potem tryumf
Opustoszały nagle fronty
W kwiatach już prezydenta grób
A tam transporty i transporty
Czerwony świt się z nocy budzi
Z woli wyborców odszedł Churchill
A tam transporty żywych ludzi
A tam obozy długiej śmierci
Nie miejcie więc do Trójcy żalu
Wyrok historii za nią stał
Opracowany w każdym calu
Każdy z nich chronił, co już miał
Mógł mylić się zwiedziony chwilą
Nie był Polakiem ani Bałtem
Tylko ofiary się nie mylą
I tak rozumieć trzeba Jałtę

Jacek Kaczmarski - Zbroja

Dałeś mi Panie zbroję, dawny kuł płatnerz ją
W wielu pogięta bojach, w wielu ochrzczona krwią
W wykutej dla giganta potykam się co krok
Bo jak sumienia szantaż uciska lewy bok
Lecz choć zaginął hełm i miecz
Dla ciała żadna w niej ostoja
To przecież w końcu ważna rzecz
Zbroja
Magicznych na niej rytów dziś nie odczyta nikt
Ale wykuta z mitów i wieczna jest jak mit
Do ciała mi przywarła, nie daje żyć i spać
A tłum się cieszy z karła, co chce giganta grać
Lecz choć zaginął hełm i miecz
Dla ciała żadna w niej ostoja
Bo przecież w końcu ważna rzecz
Zbroja
A taka w niej powaga dawno zaschniętej krwi
Że czuję jak wymaga i każe rosnąć mi
Być może nadaremnie, lecz stanę w niej za stu
Zdejmij ją Panie ze mnie, jeśli umrę podczas snu
Bo choć zaginął hełm i miecz
Dla ciała żadna w niej ostoja
To w końcu życia warta rzecz
Zbroja
You might also likeWrzasnęli hasło "wojna", zbudzili hufce hord
Zgwałcona noc spokojna ogląda pierwszy mord
Goreją świeże rany, hańbiona płonie twarz
Lecz nam do obrony dany pamięci pancerz nasz
Choć, choć za ciosem pada cios
I wróg posiłki śle w konwojach
Nas przed upadkiem chroni wciąż
Zbroja
Wywlekli pudła z blachy, natkali kul do luf
I straszą sami w strachu, strzelają do ciał i słów
Zabrońcie żyć wystrzałem, niech zatryumfuje gwałt
Nad każdym wzejdzie ciałem pamięci żywej kształt
Choć słońce skrył bojowy gaz
I żołdak pławi się w rozbojach
Wciąż przed upadkiem chroni nas
Zbroja
Wytresowali świnie, kupili sobie psy
I w pustych słów świątyni stawiają ołtarz krwi
Zawodzi przed bałwanem półślepy kapłan-łgarz
I każdym nowym zdaniem hartuje pancerz nasz
Choć krwią zachłysnął się nasz czas
Choć myśli toną w paranojach
Jak zawsze chronić będzie nas
Zbroja

Jacek Kaczmarski - Epitafium dla Włodzimierza Wysockiego

To moja droga z piekła do piekła
W dół na złamanie karku gnam!
Nikt mnie nie trzyma, nikt nie prześwietla
Nie zrywa mostów, nie stawia bram!
Po grani! Po grani!
Nad przepaścią bez łańcuchów, bez wahania!
Tu na trzeźwo diabli wezmą
Zdradzi mnie rozsądek - drań
W wilczy dół wspomnienia zmienią
Ostrą grań!
Po grani! Po grani! Po grani!
Tu mi drogi nie zastąpią pokonani!
Tylko łapią mnie za nogi
Krzyczą - nie idź! Krzyczą - stań!
Ci, co w pół stanęli drogi
I zębami, pazurami kruszą grań!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
W przepaść na łeb na szyję skok!
"Boskiej Komedii" nowy przekład
I w pierwszy krąg piekła mój pierwszy krok!
Tu do mnie! Tu do mnie!
Ruda chwyta mnie dziewczyna swymi dłońmi
I do końskiej grzywy wiąże
Szarpię grzywę - rumak rży!
Ona - co ci jest mój książę? -
Szepce mi...
You might also likeDo piekła! Do piekła! Do piekła!
Nie mam czasu na przejażdżki wiedźmo wściekła!
- Nie wiesz ty co cię tam czeka -
Mówi sine tocząc łzy
- Piekło też jest dla człowieka!
Nie strasz, nie kuś i odchodząc zabierz sny!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Wokół postaci bladych tłok
Koń mnie nad nimi unosi z lekka
I w drugi krąg kieruje krok!
Zesłani! Zesłani!
Naznaczeni, potępieni i sprzedani!
Co robicie w piekła sztolniach
Brodząc w błocie, depcząc lód!
Czy śmierć daje ludzi wolnych
Znów pod knut!?
- To nie tak! To nie tak! To nie tak!
Nie użalaj się nad nami - tyś poeta!
Myśmy raju znieść nie mogli
Tu nasz żywioł, tu nasz dom!
Tu nie wejdą ludzie podli
Tutaj żaden nas nie zdziesiątkuje grom!
- Pani bagien, mokradeł i śnieżnych pól
Rozpal w łaźni kamienie na biel!
Z ciał rozgrzanych niech się wytopi ból
Tatuaże weźmiemy na cel!
Bo na sercu, po lewej, tam Stalin drży
Pot zalewa mu oczy i wąs!
Jego profil specjalnie tam kłuli my
Żeby słyszał jak serca się rwą!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Lampy naftowe wabią wzrok
Podmiejska chata, mała izdebka
I w trzeci krąg kieruję krok:
- Wchodź śmiało! Wchodź śmiało!
Nie wiem jak ci trafić tutaj się udało!
Ot jak raz samowar kipi, pij herbatę
Synu, pij!
Samogonu z nami wypij!
Zdrowy żyj!
Nam znośnie! Nam znośnie!
Tak żyjemy niewidocznie i bezgłośnie!
Pożyjemy i pomrzemy
Nie usłyszy o nas świat
A po śmierci wypijemy
Za przeżytych w dobrej wierze parę lat!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Miasto a w Mieście przy bloku blok
Wciągam powietrze i chwiejny z lekka
Już w czwarty krąg kieruję krok!
Do cyrku! Do cyrku! Do kina!
Telewizor włączyć - bajka się zaczyna!
Mama w sklepie, tata w barze
Syn z pepeszy tnie aż gra!
Na pionierskiej chuście marzeń
Gwiazdę ma!
Na mecze! Na mecze! Na wiece!
Swoje znać, nie rzucać w oczy się bezpiece!
Sąsiad - owszem, wypić można
Lecz to sąsiad, brat - to brat
Jak świat światem do ostrożnych
Zwykł należeć i uśmiechać się ten świat!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Na scenie Hamlet, skłuty bok
Z którego właśnie krew wyciekła -
To w piąty krąg kolejny krok!
O Matko! O Matko!
Jakże mogłaś jemu sprzedać się tak łatwo!
Wszak on męża twego zabił
Zgładzi mnie, splugawi tron
Zniszczy Danię, lud ograbi
Bijcie w dzwon!

- Nie, w tej formie to nie może wcale pójść!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Wódka i piwo, koniak, grog
Najlepszych z nas ostatnia Mekka
I w szósty krąg kolejny krok!
Na górze! Na górze! Na górze!
Chciałoby się żyć najpełniej i najdłużej!
O to warto się postarać!
To jest nałóg, zrozum to!
Tam się żyje jak za cara!
I ot co!
Na dole, na dole, na dole
Szklanka wódki i razowy chleb na stole!
I my wszyscy tam - i tutaj
Tłum rozdartych dusz na pół
Po huśtawce mdłość i smutek
Choćbyś nawet co dzień walił głową w stół!
To moja droga z piekła do piekła
Z wolna zapada nade mną mrok
Więc biesów szpaler szlak mi oświetla
Bo w siódmy krąg kieruję krok!
Tam milczą i siedzą
I na moją twarz nie spojrzą - wszystko wiedzą
Siedzą, ale nie gadają
Mętny wzrok spod powiek lśni
Żują coś, bo im wypadły
Dawno kły!
Więc stoję! Więc stoję! Więc stoję!
A przed nimi leży w teczce życie moje!
Nie czytają, nie pytają -
Milczą, siedzą - kaszle ktoś
A za oknem werble grają -
Znów parada, święto albo jeszcze coś...
I pojąłem co chcą ze mną zrobić tu
I za gardło porywa mnie strach!
Koń mój zniknął a wy siedmiu kręgów tłum
Macie w uszach i w oczach piach!
Po mnie nikt nie wyciągnie okrutnych rąk
Mnie nie będą katować i strzyc!
Dla mnie mają tu jeszcze ósmy krąg!
Ósmy krąg, w którym nie ma już nic
Pamiętajcie wy o mnie co sił! Co sił!
Choć przemknąłem przed wami jak cień!
Palcie w łaźni, aż kamień się zmieni w pył -
Przecież wrócę, gdy zacznie się dzień!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Stworzenie Świata

Stworzenie świata nie przychodzi łatwo
Pierwszego dnia pierwszego dnia
Oddzieliłem tylko od ciemności światło
I Ziemi nadałem kształt
Zdecydowałem co złe być ma co dobre
A to był całej rzeczy zaczyn
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył pierwszy dzień mej pracy
W działaniu trzeba poznać kolej rzeczy
Drugiego dnia drugiego dnia
Dzieliłem wody tak by niebo sklepić
Z jednego świata uczyniłem dwa
Tak kształt materii dążył z myśli prądem
Gdy z nieba w morza poszły deszczu strugi
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył pracy mej dzień drugi
W tworzeniu szkodzi marzeń niecierpliwość
Trzeciego dnia trzeciego dnia
Powoli kształty ziemskiego tworzywa
Dobyłem z oceanów dna
Dałem bogactwo roślin w owoc płodnych
Co bezmiar życia na ziemi roznieci
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył pracy mej dzień trzeci
You might also likePanować światu to sekrety mnożyć
Czwartego dnia czwartego dnia
Sypnąłem gwiazdy w ciemność ziemskiej nocy
I słońce w jasność dnia
W ruch poszły wszystkie pełnej władzy żądne
Dzień ruszył w pościg za nocą uparty
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył pracy mej dzień czwarty
Przepych określa panowania zasięg
Piątego dnia piątego dnia
Niebo ozdabiam w klucze plemion ptasich
Ożywiam morskie dna
Ptak się upaja traw rozgrzanych swądem
Wszelki stwór morski wśród fal się przewraca
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył piąty dzień mej pracy
I nie ma władzy bez czci i pokory
Szóstego dnia szóstego dnia
Poszły zwierzęta dzikie w ziemskie bory
I człowiek taki jak ja
Kobietę zmysły i myśli ma swobodne
Które gdy trzeba ujść mogą przez usta
Po czym uznałem dzieło swe za mądre
Na tym się skończył pracy mej dzień szósty
Oto porządek nie do zastąpienia
Wszelkie istnienie żyje swoim torem
Człowiek panuje wszelkiemu istnieniu
Władzę nad sobą uznając z pokorą
Siódmego dnia siódmego dnia
Ogarnął wszechświat jasny żar południa
Stworzywszy w tydzień rajski świat
Odpoczywałem przez cały dzień siódmy

Do pociągu sporo czasu jeszcze było
Można zatem wypić kawę, albo rzucić cos na ząb
Bo nikt nie wie kiedy człek znów napcha ryło
Wtem słyszymy kół stukoty i lokomotywy świst
Więc rzucamy się do wyjścia na perony
Ale w miejscu na zatrzymał megafonów zgrzyt i pisk
- To nie wasz pociąg! - ogłosiły megafony
Uwierzyliśmy megafonom
Uprzejmie wszak ostrzegły nas
Po co stać w deszczu na peronie
Skoro przed nami jeszcze czas
Żarcie szybko się skończyło, nuda zagroziła nam
Zaczęliśmy drzemać, marzyć i flirtować
Ktoś przygrywał na gitarze, zanucili tu i tam
Zaciążyły nam do tyłu nasze głowy
Wtem słyszymy kół stukoty i lokomotywy świst

W garść się wzięliśmy i dalej na perony

Choć już wiele, wiele świtów przeminęło
I patrzymy w starcze oczy powstrzymując drżenie rąk
Zadziwieni, gdzie się życie nam podziało
Wybiegamy na perony, lecz na torach leży rdza
Semafory hen pod lasem opuszczone
Żaden pociąg nie zabierze już z tej poczekalni nas
Milczą teraz niepotrzebne megafony
I gorzko się zapatrzyliśmy
W zabrane nam dalekie strony
I w duszach swych przeklinaliśmy

Na smyczy trzymam filozofów Europy
Podparłam armią marmurowe Piotra stropy
Mam psy, sokoły, konie, kocham łów szalenie
A wokół same zające i jelenie
Pałace stawiam głowy ścinam
Kiedy mi przyjdzie na to chęć
Mam biografów, portrecistów
I jeszcze jedno pragnę mieć...
Stój Katarzyno! koronę carów
Sen taki jak ten może ci z głowy zdjąć
Kobietą jestem ponad miarę swoich czasów
Nie bawią mnie umizgi bladych lowelasów
Ich miękkich palców dotyk budzi obrzydzenie
Już wolę łowić zające i jelenie
Ze wstydu potem ten i ów
Rzekł o mnie: niewyżyta Niemra
I pod batogiem nago biegł
Po śniegu dookoła Kremla
Stój Katarzyno...
Kochanka trzeba mi takiego jak imperium
Co by mnie brał tak, jak ja daję: całą pełnią
Co by i władcy i poddańca był wcieleniem
By mi zastąpił zające i jelenie

Kim jest ten człowiek, który ciągle za mną idzie?

Wiem, że on wie, że ja się strasznie jego boję
Wiem, że coś mówi, lecz zatkałam uszy swoje!

Słońce błyśnie między wschodem a zachodem
Mimochodem obrysuje miasto chmur
Jednych dziegciem dzień nakarmi, innych miodem
Temu głowę wzniesie, temu napnie sznur
Trochę starsze znów się stanie to, co młode
Jakby strzepnął ptak kolejną kroplę z piór -
Mimochodem, mimochodem
Jakby strzepnął kroplę z piór
Tym pod nogi róż kobierzec, tamtym - kłodę
Pozostałym, mimochodem - byle co
Frustrat skargę śle, laureat pisze odę
Raz się dobro jawi złem, raz - dobrem zło
Słowo wpada w morze słów, jak kamień w wodę
Krążek myśli pozostawi, brnąc na dno -
Mimochodem, mimochodem
Krążek myśli, brnąc na dno
Cierpi syty, niepojętym zdjęty głodem
Zgłodniałego - mimochodem syci złość
Temu - mostu przęsło, temu - dom z ogrodem
Komuś o coś chodzi, za kimś - chodzi coś:
Na stracenie, na pożytek i na szkodę
Jak złośliwie między psy rzucona kość -
Mimochodem, mimochodem
Między psy rzucona kość

Sen - za jawę biorą, karę - za nagrodę
Odtwarzając krótkie scherzo swe - bez nut
Mimochodem, mimochodem
Krótkie scherzo - bez nut
Nic już więcej z tego rymu nie wywiodę
Mimochodem układając cierpką pieśń
Pocieszenie tylko dodam na osłodę
Że w niej drzemie mimochodem ważka treść:
Chwila światła między wschodem a zachodem
Wobec której trudno tak po prostu przejść
Mimochodem, mimochodem
Trudno tak po prostu przejść
Mimochodem...

Łeb mu wcisnąłem w mokrą grudę żwiru
Dziesięcioletni mój przyjaciel Świrus
Wstrzymując oddech - użył scyzoryka.
Zwierzak się szarpał, krew wsiąkała w żwir,
Fruwała w kłakach wystraszona sierść.
Rozwarła się pod ostrzem kocia pierś
W łysiny płuc i śliski kiszek wir.
Wiotczał pod dłonią protest żywych sił
Łomotał w sercu zachwycony lęk,
Aż o żywotach kota dziewięciu przesąd pękł
W cynobry nerwów i błękity żył.
Takie wspomnienie nić pamięci mota.
Świrus chirurgiem został, znanym w kraju
I wie, gdzie życia kończy się istota;
Ja piszę wiersze o śmierci Rodzaju...

1 ContributorTestament ‘95 LyricsW trzydziestym ósmym roku życia
Pod koniec dwudziestego wieku,
Co nic już chyba do odkrycia
Nie ma ni w sobie, ni w człowieku -
Za czarne pióro i atrament
Chwytam, by spisać swój testament.
Za mną już liczba chrystusowa
Ofiarnym kozłom przypisana,
Kiedy niewinna spada głowa
Za cudze grzechy - czyli za nas,
By z życia się wymknąwszy sideł
Uschnąć w relikwię wśród kadzideł.
Przede mną dziesięć lat niepewnych,
Gdy każdy zmierzch mężczyznę miażdży,
Od wewnątrz pośpiech szarpie gniewny,
A z nieba mu znikają gwiazdy.
Który to przetrwa ten - dożyje
Zaszczytu, że sędziwie zgnije.
Mniej ważne - ile czasu trawisz,
Niż - z jakim trawisz go wynikiem.
Niejedną twarz mi los przyprawił:
Byłem już zdrajcą i pomnikiem,
Degeneratem, bohaterem,
A wszystkie twarze były szczere.
Patrzono na mnie przez soczewki
Miłości, złości, interesu,
Przeinaczano moje śpiewki,
By się stawały tym, czym nie są.
Tak używano mnie w potrzebie
Aż dziw, że jeszcze mam ciut siebie.
Poza tym zresztą mam niewiele.
Wpływy przejadłem i przepiłem.
Co nieco w duszy tkwi i w ciele
(Co duszy wstrętne - ciału miłe),
Więc nie zostawiam potomności
Kont, akcji ani posiadłości.
Pierwszej małżonce mojej, Ince,
Nim się wyrazi o mnie szpetnie,
Zostawiam nasze wspólne sińce -
Pamiątki z wojny wieloletniej.
Ja się przeglądam w tych orderach,
Bo to, co boli - nie umiera.
Zaś drugiej mojej połowicy
Niczego nie zapiszę za nic,
Bo choćbym nie wiem jak policzył -
I tak mnie za rozrzutność zgani;
Więc nim się zrobi krótkie spięcie -
"Kocham cię" - piszę w testamencie.
Także synowi memu, Kosmie
Niewiele mam do zapisania.
Nie wiem co będzie, gdy dorośnie:
Czy zada cios mi, czy pytania
I próżno mi się dzisiaj biedzić,
Czy znajdę na nie odpowiedzi.
Paci zabawek nie pomnożę,
A zapisuję jej przestrogę,
Że choć się wiecznie bawić może -
Nie taką jej wyśniłem drogę.
Lecz snem nie będę córki dręczył:
Zjawi się drań, co mnie wyręczy!
Przykra to myśl, że - gdy czterdziestkę
Poranny wieszczy reumatyzm -
Tak łatwo w ten testament mieszczę
Wszystkie me lary i penaty:
Gitarę, książki i zapiski,
Butelkę po ostatniej whisky.
Nic nie zapiszę więc Wałęsom,
Pawlakom, Strąkom i Urbanom,
Co codziennością naszą trzęsą,
A ja ich muszę strząsać rano.
I przyjaciółki mej Grabowskiej
Grę z nimi biorę za słabostkę.
Zostały jeszcze pieśni. One
Już, chcę czy nie chcę, nie są moje.
Niech cierpią los swój - raz stworzone
Na beznadziejny bój z ustrojem.
Sczezł ustrój, a słowami pieśni
Wciąż okładają się współcześni.
Ja z nimi nic wspólnego nie mam
(To znaczy z ludźmi, nie z pieśniami)
Niech sobie znajdą własny temat
I niech go wyśpiewają sami.
Inaczej zdradzą wielbiciele
Że nie pojęli ze mnie wiele.
Partnerzy także źródłem troski -
Ciąży przyjaźni kamień młyński:
Niezbyt wysilał się Gintrowski,
Nazbyt wysilał się Łapiński.
Tyleśmy wspólnie wznieśli modlitw -
Rozeszliśmy się bez melodii.
W ten czas tak marny, hałaśliwy,
Gdy szybki efekt myśl połyka,
Chóralne plączą się porywy,
Muzyka wszelka w zgiełku znika.
Lecz, chociaż z nieuchronnym smutkiem,
Każdy niech swoją nuci nutkę.
O, nie samotne to nucenie!
Ani obejrzy się pustelnik -
Zjawią się wielcy ocaleni
Z historii rusztów i popielnic
By szydzić wprzód a potem kusić
I do sprostania im przymusić.
Bo nie przypadkiem przeszli czyściec
Odsiani z mód wartkiego ścieku
Po to by istnieć (a nie błyszczeć)
I wieść dysputę o człowieku.
W przepyszne wciągną cię katusze
Nie byle jakie łby i dusze.
Dyskusja z nimi więc jest czysta.
Podstępna tylko z naszej strony.
Czym grozi nam antagonista
Co przed wiekami pogrzebiony?
A dodam jeszcze myśl, że i my
Niedługo już będziemy z nimi.
To samo pod rozwagę daję
Kochankom moim bez wyjątku:
Jakże do syta tym się najeść
Co końcem było od początku?
Imion rozkoszy więc nie podam,
Bo życia mało, czasu szkoda.
Dlatego też się kończyć godzi.
Nie wiem, czy jeszcze co napiszę,
Lecz tylem już wierszydeł spłodził,
Że jest czym okpić po mnie ciszę.
Zwłaszcza że póki słońce świeci
Wciąż będą rodzić się poeci.
Jak ja bezczelni i bezradni
Spragnieni grzechu i spowiedzi
I jedną nogą już w zapadni,
Dociekający co w nich siedzi,
Co wciąż nieuchronności przeczy,
Że może życie jest do rzeczy.

Jacek Kaczmarski - 1788

1 Contributor1788 LyricsTa pierwsza morska podróż do Australii!
Łotry przy burtach, prostytutki w kojach -
Wszyscy się bali, łkali i rzygali
W drodze do raju. Przewrotności Twoja
Panie, coś w jeszcze nam nieznanych planach
Miał czarne diabły strzegące wybrzeży
Edenu, który przeznaczyłeś dla nas,
A w który nikt, prawdę mówiąc, nie wierzył!
Czym żeśmy, marni, zasłużyli na to?
Ten, co zawisnąć miał za kradzież płaszcza -
Płakał nad swoją niechybną zatratą;
Nie widział Ciebie w robaczywych masztach
Statku, co tylko był więzieniem nowym;
Tej, co kupczyła ciałami swych dziatek -
Ani przez mgnienie nie przyszło do głowy,
Że to nadziei - nie rozpaczy statek.
Niejeden żołnierz z ponurej eskorty
(Bo czym się los ich od naszego różnił?)
Wiedział, że nigdy już nie ujrzy portu,
Gdzie go podejmą karczmarze usłużni
I płatne dziewki; że zabraknie rumu
Zanim do celu przygnasz okręt szparki.
Z marynarzami pili więc na umór
I - wbrew zakazom - grali o więźniarki.
Prawda, nie wszyscy próby Twe przetrwali,
Ale też ciężkoś nas doświadczał, Panie:
Nie oszczędzałeś nam wysokiej fali,
Za którą mnogim przyszło w oceanie
Zakończyć żywot; innym dziąsła zgniły,
Wypadły zęby, rozgorzały wrzody...
Więc znaczą nasz zielony szlak mogiły
Szkorbutu, szału, francuskiej choroby.
Nikt nie odnajdzie w ruchomych otchłaniach
Ciał nieszczęśników - oprócz Ciebie, Boże.
Ich żywot grzeszny epitafiów wzbrania,
Lecz - ukarani. Więc wystarczy może,
Żeś się posłużył straszliwym przykładem:
Oni naprawdę dotarli do piekieł,
A umierając nie wierzył z nich żaden,
Że w swym cierpieniu umiera - człowiekiem.
Ląd nam się wydał niegościnny, dziki;
Łotr bez honoru, kobieta sprzedajna
Z dnia na dzień - jak się ma stać osadnikiem
Nieznanych światów? Bo rozpoznać Raj nam
Nie było łatwo; znaleźć w sobie siłę,
Wbrew przeciwnościom, bez słowa zachęty
By mimo wszystko żyć - nim nam odkryłeś
Kraj szczodry w zboże, złoto i diamenty.
Łajdacki pomiot, łotrowskie nasienie
Czerpiąc ze spichrza Twoich dóbr wszelakich -
Choć tyle wiemy własnym doświadczeniem:
W nas jest Raj, Piekło -
I do obu - szlaki.

Jacek Kaczmarski - Nie lubię

Nie lubię gdy mi mówią po imieniu
Gdy w zdaniu jest co drugie słowo - brat
Nie lubię gdy mnie klepią po ramieniu
Z uśmiechem wykrzykując - kopę lat!
Nie lubię gdy czytają moje listy
Przez ramię odczytując treść ich kart
Nie lubię tych co myślą, że na wszystko
Najlepszy jest cios w pochylony kark
Nie znoszę gdy do czegoś ktoś mnie zmusza
Nie znoszę gdy na litość brać mnie chce
Nie znoszę gdy z butami lezą w duszę
Tym bardziej gdy mi napluć w nią starają się
Nie znoszę much, co żywią się krwią świeżą
Nie znoszę psów, co szarpią mięsa strzęp
Nie znoszę tych, co tępo w siebie wierzą
Gdy nawet już ich dławi własny pęd!
Nie cierpię poczucia bezradności
Z jakim zaszczute zwierzę patrzy w lufy strzelb
Nie cierpię zbiegów złych okoliczności
Co pojawiają się gdy ktoś osiąga cel
Nie cierpię więc z niewyjaśnionych przyczyn
Nie cierpię niepowetowanych strat
Nie cierpię liczyć niespełnionych życzeń
Nim mi ostatnie uprzejmy spełni kat

Gdy wytłumaczeń dla łajdactw szukam swych
Kiedy uśmiecham się do tych którym służę
Choć z całej duszy nienawidzę ich!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Kara Barabasza

W karczmie z widokiem na Golgotę
Możesz się dzisiaj napić z łotrem
Leje się wino krwawe, złote
Stoły i pyski świecą mokre
Ten ścisk to zysk dla gospodarza
Wieść się po mieście szerzy chyża
Że można ujrzeć tu zbrodniarza
Co właśnie wyłgał się od krzyża
Żyjemy! Dobra nasza!
Co z życia chcesz, za życia bierz!
Pijmy za Barabasza!
Barabasz pije też!
Pije, lecz mowy nie odzyskał
Jeszcze nie pojął, że ocalał
Dłoń, która kubek wina ściska -
Jakby ściskała łeb bretnala
Stopy pod stołem plącze w tańcu
Szaleńca, co o drogę pyta:
Każda z nich stopą jest - skazańca

Jacek Kaczmarski - Autoportret z psem

Mój pies nie lubi psów
A ja nie lubię ludzi
Woń zadów, jazgot słów
Obu nas szczerze nudzi
Czasami ktoś się zbliży
Upewnić się czym pachnę
I pies mój go poliże
I ja ogonem machnę
A ów w słabiznę mi
Swój nos bezczelnie wtyka
I tylko po to, by
Z pogardą się odsikać
Więc odchodzimy w dal
Nie dbając o ogładę
Brodząc z połyskiem fal
Za swoim własnym śladem
Mój pies nie lubi psów
A ja nie lubię ludzi
Woń zadów, jazgot słów
Obu nas szczerze nudzi
Czasem, jak pomylony
Pędzi za którąś z suczek -
Ja miałem już dwie żony
I starczy nam nauczek
Więc go do wody - buch!
Wrzucam wśród fal rozprysków
Wprawiamy łapy w ruch
I radość bije z pysków
Potem w słonecznym śnie
Sierść nam paruje słono
Więc otrząsamy się
Od nosów do ogonów

Ja drapię się - gdzie swędzi -
On liże się po jajach
Mieszamy tak dzień w dzień
Te piesko-ludzkie światy
Wdychamy przestrzeń lśnień
Rzucamy sobie patyk
Mną szczęsny skowyt łka:
Jak pięknie bez człowieka!
Jak pięknie jest bez psa!
Zgodnie mój pies zaszczeka
I aż nas zmierzch ostudzi
Siedzimy tak we dwóch -
Bo on nie lubi ludzi
A ja - nie lubię psów

Jeszcze pod ręką globus - z taką mapą świata
Na jaką stać strategie, plany i marzenia
Jeszcze insygnia władzy, sobolowa szata
Gęsty trefiony włos i ręki gest bez drżenia
Jeszcze w zasięgu dłoni zegar, jeszcze wcześnie
Pewności siebie ruch wskazówki nie odbiera
Wzrok - lustro duszy, widzi wszystko nawet we śnie
Któremu spokój niesie cyfra i litera

Tyle zrobili już jak na swe młode lata
Ulega dziejów wosk ich nieomylnym śladom
To George de Selve, obiecujący dyplomata
I Jean de Dinteville, francuski ambasador

Dyskretny przepych - tylko echem dostojeństwa
Turecki dywan, włoska lutnia - znak obycia
W milczących ustach bezwzględnego smak zwycięstwa
W postawach - wielkość, osiągnięta już za życia
Ciężka kotara obu wspiera tym co kryje
Patrzą przed siebie śmiało, pewni swoich racji
Wszak dyplomacja włada wszystkim dziś co żyje
A oni - kwiat szesnastowiecznej dyplomacji!

Strzałka zegara iść zaczyna coraz prędzej!
Straszliwy kształt przed nimi zjawia się w pół kroku
I niszczy spokój - czy artysta się wygłupia?
Nie, to nie żart! Na kształt ten trzeba spojrzeć z boku!
Żeby zobaczyć jasno, że to czaszka trupia!

Jacek Kaczmarski - Czołg

Gąsienicami zagrzebany w piach nad Wisłą
Patrzę przez rzekę pustym peryskopem
Na miasto w walce, które jest tak blisko
Że Wisły nurt frontowym staje się okopem
Rozgrzany pancerz pod wrześniowym żarem
Rwie do ataku się i pali pod dotykiem
Ale wystygły silnik śpi pod skrzepłym smarem
I od miesiąca nie siadł nikt za celownikiem
Krtań lufy łaknie znów pocisków smaku
A łyka tylko tłusty dym z drugiego brzegu
W słuchawkach zdjętych hełmofonów krzyk Polaków
I nie wiem czemu rzeki tej nie wziąłem z biegu
Dajcie mi wgryźć się gąsienicą w fale śliskie
I ogniem z lufy dajcie wesprzeć barykady
By miasto w walce, które jest tak bliskie
Bezruchu mego nie nazwało mianem zdrady
Lecz milczy sztab i milczą pędy tataraku
Którymi mnie przed tymi co czekają skryto
Bo ruski tank nie będzie walczył za Polaków
Bo ruski tank zaczekać ma, by ich wybito
Gdy się wypali już powstanie ciemnym błyskiem
Włączą mi silnik i rozgrzeją krew maszyny
Bym mógł obejrzeć miasto, co tak bliskie

Jacek Kaczmarski - Katyń

Ciśnie się do światła niby warstwy skóry
Tłok patrzących twarzy spod ruszonej darni
Spoglądają jedna znad drugiej - do góry
Ale nie ma ruin. To nie gród wymarły...
Raz odkryte - krzyczą zatęchłymi usty
Lecą sobie przez ręce wypróchniałe w środku
W rów, co nigdy więcej nie będzie już pusty
Ale nie ma krzyży. To nie groby przodków...
Sprzączki i guziki z orzełkiem ze rdzy
Po miskach czerepów - robaków gonitwy
Zgniłe zdjęcia, pamiątki, mapy miast i wsi
Ale nie ma broni. To nie pole bitwy...
Może wszyscy byli na to samo chorzy?
Te same nad karkiem okrągłe urazy
Przez które do ziemi dar odpłynął Boży
Ale nie ma znaków, że to grób zarazy...
Jeszcze rosną drzewa, które to widziały
Jeszcze ziemia pamięta kształt buta, smak krwi
Niebo zna język, w którym komendy padały
Nim padły wystrzały, którymi wciąż brzmi
Ale to świadkowie żywi - więc stronniczy
Zresztą, by ich słuchać - trzeba wejść do zony
Na milczenie tych świadków może pan ich liczyć
Pan powietrza i ziemi i drzew uwięzionych

Gdzie coś, co nie istnieje - wciąż o pomstę woła
Gdzie już śmiechem nawet mogiła nie czczona

Na Myśliwieckiej, przy Czerniakowskiej
Jak w Łazienkowske się wjedzie
Mieszkali sobie stworzenia boskie:
Baron z prawdziwem Niedźwiedziem
Chodzili sobie w lato upalne
Na Agrykole zielone
Takie dwa byty transcendentalne:
Niedźwiedź z prawdziwem Baronem
Niedźwiedź miał trochę miodu na paszczy
A Baron oczy przekrwione
Bo żywot wiedli strasznie hulaszczy
Niedźwiedź z prawdziwem Baronem
I przehulaliby cały pałac
Wszystko by zżarła gangrena
Gdyby za twarz ich nie przytrzymała
Pеwna brutalna Helena
Czarna Helеna hoduje bluszcza
Sadzi begonie w donice
Tylko na stadion nikt jej nie wpuszcza
Bo się jej boją kibice
Czarna Helena ma dużo wdzięku
I innych zalet ma parę
Wianek na głowie, badylek w ręku
A przed nią bieży o(O)wczarek
Słuchajcie ludzie ballady mojej
Co już skończona jest prawie
Mieszkajom sobie zgodnie we troje

Jakiś bunt się w koniu budzi
Z niepokojem patrzy w dal
Tylko ludzi tylko ludzi

Zanim pierwszy stos zapłonie
Może byś se tak rodaku

W kamienicy Żyda Kohna
Najpiękniejszą z wszystkich cieszyńską perłą

Szprechałaby czasem, a śmiech by miała boski
Raz na sto lat cud by się dokonał

W zdrowiu żył trzydzieści lat na tym świecie
I całe długie życie przede mną

A z okien snułby się zapach
Świątecznych potraw

Artur Andrus - Czarna Helena po roku

Chociaż już dawno skończone żniwa
Choć odleciały żurawie
Czarna Helena nadal przebywa
Na Myśliwieckiej w Warszawie
Hoduje sobie kwiatki w pokoju
Interesuje się dżinsem
I nagle... Bach! Na liście przebojów
Wygrywa z Philem Collinsem
Sukces nie zepsuł jej ani deczko
I nie zmieniła się ona
Nadal brutalnie, twardom piąsteczkom
Trzyma jednego Barona
I wielka sława też jej nie kusi
Choć świat się o niej dowiedział
Bo wie, że przecież pilnować musi
Transcendеntnego Niedźwiedzia
I jеszcze paru takich, że rany
Czarna Helena też niańczy
Na przykład Hendryk wysportowany
Co na rowerze zatańczy
Albo też Wojtek, co gra muzykę
I językami on włada
Który z postury, z tamtem Hendrykiem
Na rower raczej nie wsiada
You might also likeNa Myśliwiecke spogląda z góry
I się uśmiecha pod nosem
Baśka, co w niebie zagęszcza chmury
Zabranem stąd papierosem
Czarna Helena będzie ostojom
Świata pilnować będzie stąd
A z kibicami, co się jej bojom
Może obalić każdy rząd

Lękać się imperium zła
Ludzie, ludzie zakładajmy chóry
Wszędzie gdzie się da
Chór na dworcu
Chór na plaży
Chór upadłych dziennikarzy
Chór noszących okulary
Chór imienia Che Guevary
Chór wyniosłych decydentów
Chór wypożyczalni sprzętów
Chór powracających z gór
I zwalczających dur
Nie trać czasu na wygłupy
Miałeś chamie czapkę z piór
Ludzie, ludzie zbierzmy się do kupy
I załóżmy jakiś chór 
Chór w komendzie
Chór w szpitalu
Chór hurtowni i detalu
Chór klientów punktu ksero
Mały męski chór hetero
Chór budowy autostrady
Chór turystów spod Hurghady
I podpierających mur
Chór pradawnych cór

Danuta małżonka skina i Janina żona punka
Pozdrawiają się z daleka poprawiają rude grzywki
Jeden wózek cały w ćwiekach a drugi w pacyfki
Bawią swoje małe dzieci obgadują to i owo
Pani punko jak tam leci
A w porządku skinheadowo

O skinie manicurzyście i punku prezesie banku
O sąsiadkach i o pieskach trochę martwi się kryzysem

Zwyczajnym rybackim kutrem
I woził dorsze i śledzie
Zimą i latem, okrągły rok
Teraz jak nieraz przejedzie

Żal mi serce rwie
Pies przybłęda nie tknął nawet skórki chleba

Ja z rewolwerem nad szklanką czystej wódki
Usiadł czarny kruk na dachach Petersburga
Niech to wszystko szlag

A ja jedno wiem
Wzdychasz duszo, mój szeroki stepie

Pałac z terakoty
Chodź tu do mnie... Dziś... dziś...

Niech się Pani Misia nie lęka

Tu, na pleckach, mam znamiona
Takie mi zrobiła kuku

Zastęp harcerzy z hufca Lesko
Wytropił żółtą łódź podwodną
I przemalował ją na niebiesko
Wyrosły na niej łopian i mech
Życie jest dziwne, eh
Wyrosły na niej łopian i mech

Bo czy to Legia, Wisła czy Lech

Artur Andrus - Orzeł może

Możesz nosić okulary
Możesz kontratakować zboże
Czesać się jak Zygmunt Stary
Jesteś orzeł. Orzeł może
Spodnie możesz nosić szersze
A na bluzce wilkołaki
Ręcznie przepisywać wiersze
O, na przykład taki:
Człowieku! No przecież
Jak sam nie chcesz, to się nie ciesz
Ale niech cię tak nie peszą
Ci, co się do ciebie cieszą
Chudzi, grubi
Starzy, młodzi
Daj się lubić
Co ci szkodzi?
Możesz wracać z biblioteki
O nie przyzwoitej porze
Regulować brwi i rzeki
Jesteś orzeł. Orzеł może
Latem rzucać się na siano
Żeby sprawdzić jak się gniеcie
Możesz też o czwartej rano
Śpiewać w Internecie

Co ci szkodzi?
Możesz poznać w leśnej głuszy
Miłych państwa z Państwa Środka
Jeśli z domu się nie ruszysz
Trudno będzie kogoś spotkać
Możesz poczuć w sercu kłucie
Może zrobić się przyjemnie
Tylko raz się do mnie uciesz
Uśmiechnij się ze mnie
Człowieku! No przecież
Jak sam nie chcesz, to się nie ciesz
Ale niech cię tak nie peszą
Ci, co się do ciebie cieszą
Chudzi, grubi
Starzy, młodzi
Daj się lubić
Co ci szkodzi?

Politycy obradują za ścianami
Dzieci kwiaty przeglądają stare zdjęcia
Przyszłe matki się szykują do poczęcia
Coś mnie ciągnie by na browar rano skoczyć
Ale czuje za firanką Twoje oczy
Tylko oczy Twoje świecą jak latarnie
Bym nie zbładził kiedy chandra mnie ogarnie
Witpusty moja, witpusty moja.......
Wczoraj znowu byłem w domu po północy
Telewizor już zgaszony tylko oczy
Tylko oczy Twoje świecą jak latarnie
Bym nie zbłądził kiedy chandra mnie ogarnie
Tak jak statek co go sztorm pozbawił steru
Lecz ja nie mam, lecz ja nie mam charakteru
Bo wymykam się ukradkiem, śmieszny pajac
A Ty wciąż się drobnym kłamstwem zadowałaszYou might also like

Pytał tatarak trzcinę:
- Kochanie co Ty na to?
Rozkwitło nad Olsztynem
Astronomiczne lato
Lato astronomiczne
Gorące, artystyczne
Znów Słońce zatrzymamy
Ruszymy z Ziemią w tany
Ref
W cukierni Kopernik
W kawiarni i pizzerii
W galeriach, herbaciarniach
Euforia nas ogarnia
Na plaży już od rana
Copa Coppernicana
Z dziewczyną jak marzenie
Tańczenie na morenie
Szaleje Galaktyka
Za sprawą Kopernika
Wszak jego to robota
Że ciała są w obrotach
Ciała już się zleciały
W słoneczny układ cały
Rozgrzany apetycznie
Ciała zgoła kosmicznie

Po lasach i po polach
Wywija rock n'rolla

Kopernik nie był babą
Trzeba się obejść ze smakiem
Kopernik był Warmiakiem!!!

Tańczymy na obłokach

Zobaczył ją tak bardzo blisko
Tak naturalnie, przepiękną Lili
I zapamiętał kolor, wszystko
Już zakochany był, tak zakochany był!
Na jego oczach było olśnienie
Kolory, barwy i jej odcienie
I jeszcze ta obietnica dana:
Ja namaluję Lili dzień!

Szarawy świat odejdzie szybko
Poleci z nieba kolorowy pył
Powoli wiatrem spadał nisko
Zaczarowany był, zaczarowany był!
On zakochany był jej radością
Zauroczony w korowodzie słów!
I poza jego świadomością
Odwagę dano mu, żeby do Lili mówił jedno:

Ja namaluję dzień Twoją ręką
Na Ziemi pojawi się cud
Dotykiem koloruję na niebiesko
Zamieni się czarne na róż!

I parę złotych róż, i kilka białych róż!

Od miasta aż po wsie
I popalone domy nocą

What they're doing? Why there's sadness right behind you?
That's a fact, night just ain't no black
There's no argue
Turning into wreck, still looking back at the past track
Real vision turning into abstract
But the fate always waits for the ones that
Keepin' the faith, deep in their heads you got that?

Urodził się, sam dzisiaj nie wie gdzie
Nie widział słońca ni nieba też
Ojciec mu wrogi, mamy nie znał więc
Samotnie ciągle witał nowy dzień
Dlaczego ja? Tak Boga pytał się
Naprawdę skrzydeł tych nie mogę mieć?
Rozłożył ręce, chyba tego chce
I jego oczy mówią „leć”

Raj, którego nocą pragniesz
Tak, jak ja
To niebo, to raj
Dalej, dalej proszę, leć, proszę, gnaj!
Raj, którego nocą pragniesz
Tak, jak ja
To niebo, to raj
Dalej, dalej proszę, leć, proszę, gnaj!

Kolejny dzień, kolejna taka noc
Kiedy pokochać go nie miał kto
A ile można modlić się o lont
Który zapłonie kiedy chciałby on
Zalany łzami, śniło mu się, że
Że jego dusza już umie latać
Rozłożył ręce, chyba tego chce
I jego oczy mówią „leć”

Błagam cię, leć, pora już na ciebie, też
Skrzydlate ręce ma Bóg
Oddał je Tobie za ból
Kłaniają się, abyś je założył już
I poleciał gdzie ten wymarzony

Koniec Świata - 1980

Milczą jak zaklęte oszronione szyby
Myjemy się w śniegu naszej własnej zimy
Smołą plują w niebo szerokie kominy
Na dalekim wschodzie ludzie żyją wciąż na niby
Dopóki księżyc świeci dopóty nie spadnie
Wszystko co się rodzi żyje i umiera nagle
Od zmierzchu do świtu od świtu do mroku
Jakiś sąsiad dziś nam umarł naprzeciwko w bloku
Bije nam zaklęty dzwon
W świeconej wodzie palce brudnych rąk
Bliżej podszedł pod nasz próg
Zimny od śmierci duch
Wiosna już kolejna zbiera swoje żniwa
Trzymamy się mocniej siebie, by móc to wytrzymać
Dwudziestą ósmą wiosnę bierzemy na barki
Wypadają nam włosy oraz z kalendarza kartki
Na zakrętach smutku w biegu tych wydarzeń
Jak mogliśmy się tak szybko po prostu zestarzeć
Każdy tylko gorzko sam siebie przeklina
Zestarzałem się po cichu trudno to wytrzymać jest
Tarzają się ptaki w lipcowym błękicie
Zapachniało wakacjami zapachniało życiem
Przeszły letnie błyskawice pioruny i burze
Diabeł Bogu się spowiada z mym aniołem stróżem

Słychać tylko śmiech studentów z okien biblioteki
Ci po ekonomii po prawie i stosunkach
Nikt dziś nie pracuje po wyuczonych kierunkach
Bije nam zaklęty dzwon
W świeconej wodzie palce brudnych rąk
Bliżej podszedł pod nasz próg
Zimny od śmierci duch
Zapalamy świece na dziadach i pradziadach
Zimnym kocem nas otula jesień listopada
Coraz bardziej wszystko to w kręgosłup się wrzyna
Ktoś w tej chwili kończy żywot a ktoś go zaczyna
Kolędy i święta łamanie opłatkiem
Kogoś tylko znów zabrakło przy stole przypadkiem
Wracają na święta nasi emigranci
Przylatują samoloty z Niemiec, Anglii oraz Francji
Wyuczono nas zachowań, Jak jeść co wypada
Jak zachować się przy stole na obcych obiadach
Tak trudno to wszystko okiem jest oświecić
W tym codziennym bałaganie niepotrzebnych rzeczy
Niektórzy z nas życiem już zmęczeni
Jak staliśmy razem tak leżymy podzieleni
Jedni poszli w prawo lub zostali w miejscu
Drudzy całkiem w lewo inni zaś stanęli w przejściu
Czasem tylko zerkamy za siebie ukradkiem
I to co nas bardzo boli żyje w nas najbardziej wiem...

Koniec Świata - 1980 II

Chodzę tą ulicą którą znam od dawna
Wydeptałem w niej ścieżki do Boga i diabła
Oswajałem się na niej z ludźmi oraz z życiem
Przytulała mnie w nocy i budziła o świcie
Leżąc na niej widziałem spadające gwiazdy
Z ustrojem i rządem zmieniali jej nazwy
Jeszcze rosną tam drzewa w odstępach od siebie
Razem z nimi korzenie zapuszczałem pod ziemie
W obcych krajach dalekich z sercem na pagonie
W poszarpanych myślach wracałem wciąż do niej
Do tych pól malowanych zbożem rozmaitem
Posrebrzanych pszenicą pozłacanych żytem
Raz i dwa i trzy
Tą samą ulicą co świt
Kolejny krok
Za mrokiem świt za świtem wciąż mrok
Na apelach i wiecach mówcom puchną gęby
Pustoszeją w niedziele narodowe urzędy
Tyle razy to wszystko swe miejsce już miało
Jak poskładać te myśli w jedną wielką całość
Oficerom na czapkach dogasają gwiazdy
Czarne wrony tarzają się w tym co nakradły
Zakochani nie liczą już kolejnych wiosen
Starzec gnie się przy oknie pogodził się z losem
Zima składa ofiary na białe ołtarze
Dorastając w tym kraju trzeźwiejemy z marzeń
Każdy zdążył już uciec w swoja własna stronę
Słońce chowa swą paszczę za ciężką zasłonę
You might also likeTłum coś wita okrzykiem czapki lecą w górę
Jezus schodzi z krzyża by zmieszać się z tłumem
Znowu Bóg się narodzi w Boże Narodzenie
Trzej Królowie przyjadą a z nimi żołnierze
Diabeł zaciska zęby a Pan Bóg się krzywi
Z nieudanych polowań wracają myśliwi
Ograbieni z wolności przemycają ją w biegu
Własną krwią wypisują jej imię na śniegu
A na wiosnę w tym mieście rozkwitają dziewczyny
W dzikim słońcu pęcznieją wiśnie i maliny
Latem słodkie ich usta czerwienieją w słońcu
Od początku do końca i znów od początku
Ciągle jeszcze siedzimy w tym życia wagonie
Choć już wielu wysiadło na innym peronie
Ciągle jeszcze siedzimy w tym życia wagonie
Wciąż jedziemy przed siebie to jeszcze nie koniec

Koniec Świata - 4 Strony

A tutaj nic się nie zmienia
Co dzień to widzę dzień po dniu
Uwolniony od cienia
Już nie mogę złapać tchu
Mówią o wolności istnienia
A tam kajdany przyrośnięte do nóg
Czy masz coś do powiedzenia
I czy to wszystko widzi twój Bóg
Nie masz już siły nie masz już siły aby wstać
Nie masz już siły nie masz już siły aby trwać
Ze wszystkich czterech stron wciąż skrada się zło
I jak zatrzymać krwawienia
Tych nienawiści które kopią nam grób
Ilu jest bogów jakie mają sumienia
I w imię Boga ile ściąłeś już głów
Jak ostatnią siłą tchnienia
Odnaleźć drogę której nie ma i już

Gdzie te piosenki na trzy chwyty
I skromnych dziewcząt piękne twarze
Został mi ryngraf blizną ryty
I w duszy piękne tatuaże

Dokąd pójdziemy w taką burzę
Gdy chmury kłębią się nad nami
Wszyscy i tak idziemy tam
Gdzie jakiś głupiec nas prowadzi

Parę ulic stąd ktoś biegnie pod prąd
I łbem ktoś tłucze w dzwon
To był ostatni prom ostatni uścisk rąk
Nie zabierze nas nic już stąd
Zróbmy sobie dzisiaj wielki bal

I gdzie do diabła pomieszkuje
Słowo dzień dobry i dziękuję
Chamstwo się zjeżdża tu ze świata
I niedogotowana kasza

I policz dziury w moim swetrze
Otwórz butelkę pełną przygód

Koniec Świata - Bankiet

Wszystko gotowe wynajęta cała sala
Błyszczą talerze porcelana i lśni szkło
Ten bankiet potrwa dziś długo aż do rana
Społeczny pieniądz tu nikomu nie żal go
Wchodzi sekreta prokurator i pułkownik
Uprzejmym gestem przepuszczają się przez drzwi
Wczoraj w areszcie a dzisiaj jest już wolny
To pan oficer który pił przez cztery dni
Jest pan senator co z reguły bywa wszędzie
Ma brwi krzaczaste oraz strasznie długi wąs
I jeszcze w gości przyszedł a nie na kolędę
Po dwóch kielichach po cywilu Robak ksiądz
Bo to jest bankiet nad bankiety
Białe obrusy i schabowe kotlety
Wódka i szampan sokoły i śpiew
Jak chleb i ciało jak wino i krew
Jeszcze spóźniony pan prezydent i pan premier
Wszyscy czekali na nich nim zaczęli jeść
Z ust prezydenta oficjalne przemówienie
Baczność do hymnu oraz sztandarowi cześć
Z każda godziną bardziej zapełnia się parkiet
Twarze czerwone do głowy uderza krew
Orkiestra w rogu gra już głośniej na trzy czwarte
Białe mankiety hej sokoły wódka śpiew
Prezydent z pułkownikiem opuszczają sale
I chwiejnym krokiem wytaczają się na hol
Jeszcze w tym roku zrobię ciebie generałem

Wszyscy świadomi swoich salonowych ról
W obrusy wsiąka najdroższy w kraju szampan
Każdy ubrany w swój najlepszy z szafy strój
Kończy się bankiet milkną śpiewy i uściski
Resztki jedzenia oraz nadgryziony tort
Gdy zgasną światła to będzie już po wszystkim
W lustrach pijane twarze zakazanych mord
Orkiestra gra ostatni refren na trzy czwarte

Wisimy nad przepaścią i nadstawiamy kark
Po wczorajszej nocy na zębach osad mam
O jak dobrze jest z kufla pić piwo, które znam
Brzęczą muchy brzęczą szyby pod powieki dym się wkradł
Próchnieje nasz czas i drętwieją nogi
Wytrzepmy, więc z kieszeni piach
Bo znaleźliśmy się w tym koszmarnym śnie
Po tej samej stronie dnia
Życie to konieczność zrozumieliśmy to wreszcie
Stoją w miejscu nasze domy w bezrobotnym mieście
Oczy płaczą od pogardy i pełno wokół krwi
Dawno temu już przed nami zatrzaśnięto drzwi
Za każdym ciężkim ciosem kolejny pada cios
Odbija się od okien nasz zachrypnięty głos
Zastyga krew na palcach i zamarzają sny

I kobiety co brak im już łez
Razem z makijażem zmywają co wieczór
Jeden i ten sam grzech
Wiruje wokół śmierci taniec
Gwiżdże jak czajnik na gazie
Dzieciaki w brudnej piaskownicy
Zakopują w piachu różaniec
To tutaj za drzwiami bieda piszczy obok
Oswojony na klatce uśmiecha się szczur
Wykształcona nędza zaczyna być zmorą
Zanosi nas w zębach upiorom do stóp
Pchają wózki kulawi złomiarze
Przez ulice zakurzonych marzeń
Piwo, przystanek czy sklep
Czują się jak potrącony pies
Resztkę szczęścia trzymają w szufladzie
Gdzieś w kanale przy autostradzie
Wiersze mają swą treść
Tak jak zero to sześć minus sześć
To tutaj za drzwiami bieda piszczy obok

Podpalili domy, miasta i kościoły
Poderżnęli gardło i ochrzcili nas krwią
I nad rzeką w środku dnia
Wiem nie spotkam Ciebie tam
Zrzucili kotwice i zamarzła mgła
Wyprodukowali bomby i wytresowali psa
Ta chwila jest w tej chwili ona trwa
Jesteś ty obok jestem ja
Wyczyścili lufy karabinów i różaniec
Wybili nam zęby i rzucili je na szaniec
I pod płaszczem haniebnych słów
Umieramy podczas snu
Przecieram oczy, by widzieć wszystko lepiej
Jak łamią pazury gryzą asfalt, drapią lód
Śmieję się przez sine łzy
Nic nie mówię i marszczę brwi
Śmieję się przez sine łzy
A gdy wyjdę zamknę drzwi
Stoję nieruchomo, nieruchomo ciągle stoję
A tuż obok mnie leży całe życie moje

Gdy bladym świtem tramwaj dzwoni
Wstaje zmęczony i myje twarz
Dwie kromki z masłem i kiełbasa
Aby w fabryce być na czas
Jeszcze go księżyc odprowadza
Nim słońce zdąży się obudzić
Mija znajome mu ulice
Mija pomniki wielkich ludzi
Tak płynie robotnicza krew strumieniem po pospolitej ziemi
I zachrypnięty śpiewa chór
O tym co szablą odbierzemy
Pociąg na dworcu i perony
Fermentacja społecznych klas
Ten pociąg wozi go do pracy
A innych zaś daleko w świat
Lecz nie dla niego wielkie kraje
Sam też najdalej był w Warszawie
Tam gdzie poselskie psy szczekają
A karawana jedzie dalej
W skrzynce niezapłacone listy
Te co przychodzą wciąż od nowa
W kieszeni w kurtce magnetyczna
Karta do pracy zegarowa

Koniec Świata - Dziewczyna Z Prowincji

Wypełnił nas spirytus
Od samych stóp do głów
A pod ukraińskim niebem
Pije anioł stróż
Nie płacz już dziewczyno
Rozmażesz z rzęsy tusz
Pod gwiazdami między nami
Koniec nerwów już
Hej dziewczyno z tej prowincji ty jedyna
Gdzie tej nocy śpisz?
Kiedy wrócisz nie wie nikt?
Już słońce za chmurami
Więc pijmy pókim zdrów
Śnieg już okrył szczyty gór
Karnawałem snów
Wszystkich pożółkłych liści
Nikt nie policzy już
Pij jak pija komuniści
Nie rozlewaj znów
Już koniec zbędnych wzruszeń
Za oknem świta znów
Polej rany spirytusem
I uciekam już

Koniec Świata - Głuche telefony

Nie ważne są systemy
Nie liczą się też rządy
Miałem się dobrze trzymać
Miałem być porządny
Nie boję się porażki
I nie dbam o zwycięstwo
Nie lubię polityków
Co życiem naszym trzęsą
Obce twarze
Ciemne korytarze
Pełne głowy
Tylko do połowy
Szare ściany
Szare panoramy
Puste domy
I głuche telefony
A ty ciągle mi uciekasz
Nie mogę cie dogonić
Nie patrzę na zegarek
Nie spieszę się już po nic
I nie dbam o to wcale
Że inni szybciej biegną
Stoję na środku drogi
Już jest mi wszystko jedno
You might also likeMiałem tu jeszcze wrócić
Iść w prawo albo w lewo

Niech inni giną w biegu

Koniec Świata - Granat w plecaku

Na pamięć znamy swą piosenkę
Już tyle czasu ręka w rękę
I podczas nerwowo iskrzących dni
Obgryzamy swe palce do krwi
Jak betonowe miasto ciemne
Znam Cię jak przeczytaną księgę
Więcej trzeba, aby siebie zadowolić
Na coraz więcej możemy sobie pozwolić
Patrzą na nas budki z papierosami
To tramwaj, który znam a w plecaku kromki mam
I niech rzucają w nas pestkami
Nie przejmuj się ja i tak w plecaku granat mam
W objęciach ulic w zamieszaniu
Jesteś zapachem na moim ubraniu
Połamane leżą łóżka drżą spuchnięte lepkie usta
Cichosza
Te obce noce w obcych ścianach
Wciąż tak często budzisz się sama
Gdzieś za miastem za murami
Skóra i ciało rozorane pazurami
Wykrztuśmy to, co siedzi w gardle
Tu na zmęczonym prześcieradle
Na mej ulicy pod nogami skrzypi śnieg
Na mym osiedlu po ścianach pełza zmierzchYou might also like

Koniec Świata - Hotel Polonia

1 ContributorHotel Polonia LyricsPo stromych miotam się urwiskach
Złotówki mi kaleczą ręce
Czuje się jak najtańsza dziwka
Jakby mi ktoś narzygał w serce
Sączą się noce i godziny
Prosto stąd do nieskończoności
Życia ruchome koleiny
Stoją na drodze do wieczności
Lubimy kąpać się w lamencie
Na siłę mydlić się pogardą
Kaleczyć się dosłownie wszędzie
Tępą patriotyczną szablą
Lubimy być jak koncert życzeń
Na siłę dziury w całym szukać
I po to istnieć żeby krzyczeć
Hasła, których się nie da słuchać
Skąd więc najbliżej jest do Polski
Z kogo prawdziwa krew wyciekła
Bóg odpowiada głosem szorstkim
Do Polski jest najbliżej z piekła
Ci którzy żywią się krwią martwą
Nie wierzą w wolność, którą mają
Może gdy sami ją wywalczą
Uwierzą w wolność odzyskaną
You might also likeW tych skserowanych blokowiskach
Idę po linie obok Ciebie
Przed nami przyszłość niezbyt czysta
I ściana z takich samych cegieł

Bóg odpowiada głosem szorstkim
Do Polski jest najbliżej z piekła

Koniec Świata - Jak mnie tu znalazłaś?

Znowu wieje wiatr
Może od Zawratu
Podzielił nas czas
Na wrogów i przyjaciół
Pamiętam twoje oczy
W każdej jednej chwili
Pamiętam twój zapach
Na twojej twardej szyi
Powiedz jak mnie tu znalazłaś
W tym rynsztoku w środku dnia
W kałuży z wyrzutów sumienia
W której odbijam się sam
Wciąż o tobie myślę
Gdy nocą śpię przy ścianie
To tylko parę chwil
A może życie całe
Jak dwa samotne drzewa
W tym samym ogrodzie
Daleko nam do siebie
Nie mamy dokąd odejść
Obce mijam miasta
Wśród śnieżnobiałych pól
Raz drzewa rosną w górę
Raz łamią się na pół
Jedni chcą mieć spokój
A drudzy chcą więcej
Chodź pójdziemy razem
Zaśpiewam ci piosenkę

Koniec Świata - Jedna ręka nie klaszce

Kurtyna w dół ostatni raz
Wygasły brawa, zamilkł wrzask
A jedna ręka choćby chciała nie zaklaszcze
Reflektor dawno tutaj zgasł
A w miejscu zatrzymał się czas
I tylko duchy się błąkają po teatrze
I w całym mieście smutno jest
To pada deszcz, to wyje pies
Zakapslowana znów w butelkach jest kultura
Więc znów bez celu szlajam się
Nikt już nie oklaskuje mnie
A ja na scenie już nie pocę się w purpurach
Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze
Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze
Brak mi emocji którem czuł
Za kulisami ludzi szum
I tak jak nigdy potrzebuję dziś dublera
Aby po prostu za mnie żył
W codzienności mętnej tkwił
Przełykał gorzkie brawa prosto od klakiera
You might also likeZabrakło życia mi i słów
I zniknął sufler mój i bóg
Więc stawiam scenę z krzywych desek na zakręcie

Bo znów ktoś słucha mnie jak mszy
A pojedyncze brawa zawsze są najszersze

Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze
Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze
I znów na scenie stoję sam
Gram swoje życie, które mam
Bez bileterów, bez Klakierów, bez kurtyny
Co poleciała z hukiem w dół
I mój złamała świat na pół
Dziś gram dla siebie bez korzyści, bez rutyny
Nie mogę nigdzie indziej być
Inaczej nie potrafię żyć
Nie chcę być cieniem w swojej własnej okolicy
Tkać swoją niewidzialną nić
W swych labiryntach sobie żyć
Prawdziwa sztuka może leżeć na ulicy
Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze
Tylko zjawy, upiory, demony i duchy
Błąkają się po teatrze
Karaluchy pod poduchy
Jedna ręka nie klaszcze

Koniec Świata - Jeszcze Mamy Rewolwery

1 ContributorJeszcze Mamy Rewolwery LyricsJeszcze mamy, o czym krzyczeć
Nikt nie zaszyje nam ust
W codziennym gwarze i o wieczornej porze
Z ust wypływa lawina słów
Co ważne jest, co po pierwsze
Kto partyzancki zerwał chrust
Jak ciężko mówi się z przyłożonym
Rewolwerem do ust
Jak rozbiegł się tłum
I zwinięto sztandary
A cesarz i król nie zmienili ról
Zza rogu historii słychać fanfary
I kiedyś na pewno wrócimy tu znów
Co warto jest, co nie warto?
Kto kradł owoce w ogrodach?
Ten sam mamy cel i te same mundury
Stąpamy po tych samych schodach
Nikt nie odważy się nas dzielić
Na tych, co bardziej na tych, którzy mniej
Mówca z krzyżykiem pan ze scyzorykiem
Nie podzieli nas za grzech

Raz jeszcze o tym, co było, co będzie

Jak młody poseł zasiadł w urzędzie
Piastował urząd i kradł
Jak ludzie wybiegli do okien
Jak pootwierały się drzwi
A my z transparentem staliśmy za zakrętem
Gdzie pierwsza ulica przecina drugą na krzyż
Rozbiegł się...
Jeszcze mamy rewolwery
Przedłużmy więc noc jak się da
Sumienia niegrzeczne łopoczą na wietrze
Każdy wie to, co wiedzieć ma
Jutro miasto zakwitnie, jak co dzień
Ciemną i jasną stroną pnie się wzwyż
A my spotkamy się znów przy urzędzie
Gdzie pierwsza ulica przecina drugą na krzyż

Rynek ziewa, co świt
Śpiewak, który zaśpiewać miał
Umarł, nie zaśpiewa nic

Jeszcze więcej niż on
Skończyli w brudnej wodzie

Szczerbaty fortepian
Coś krzyczy, krztusi się, łka
Drętwieją źrenice gorące
Tak kocha się tylko w dzień
Między prawą a lewą
Początkiem końcem i snem
Odciski zostały na głowach
Jeszcze świeża na ulicach krew
Mocniej wykręca kark
Król w ostrogach, co głupi ma cel
Za oknem i na zakręcie
Nieszczęście walimy w pysk

Tuż przed mym nosem trzaskają drzwi
Mój Bóg zły nie mówi o nic nie pyta
Sam nie wierzy w nic
Coś się wierci w mej duszy coś kotłuje się w głowie
Jakby chciało się przebić na druga połowę
Znowu zęby mnie bolą potem skronie co obok
Serce ręce i głowa na zmianę od nowa
Coś mnie wali od spodu coś przytłacza mnie z góry
Dzwony dzwonią w kościele coś mnie szarpie za struny
W głowę wala jak w bęben słowa z ekranu
Trzeba duszę oczyścić tylko pomału
Boli łeb i dzień mi umyka
Tuż przed mym nosem trzaskają drzwi
Mój Bóg zły nie mówi o nic nie pyta
Sam nie wierzy w nic
Ktoś mi krzyczy do ucha coś wykręca wątrobę
Szarpie szturcha wyrywa mi źrenice spod powiek
Życie więdnie na półce małpa tańczy na stole
Osioł świni dosiada ktoś mi skacze po głowie
Znowu trzęsie się ziemia w ustach same trociny
Już rezerwa się pali brakuje benzyny
Trzeba ciągle wiosłować wieczorem i rano
Trzeba zraszać nadzieją to co jeszcze zostało

Chociaż miało mnie tu nie być

A drzewa nucą złe pieśni o żołnierzach

Pośród rozstrzelanych pól
Omińmy szlaki
Zaminowanych dróg
Bądź ze mną tutaj

Tam mołotow doda prądu
Wciąż umieramy
Po kolei z ręki rządu
Nie wiem czy wierzyć
W te rewolucyjne czary
Jak nie ma winnych
Oskarża się ofiary
Wciąż jestem tutaj
Chociaż płaszcz mój już dziurawy
Próbuje zszywać te rozprute sztandary
Prosto do piekła
Tak tą droga pójdę stąd
Czas płynie dalej
Chociaż zakrztusił się krwią

By znów widzieć, co widziałem

Zagaś już światło zakręć kran
Skwierczy serce coś u góry
Wyrywa kości spod skóry
A ta jedna myśl nerwowa
Rozszarpuje mnie bez słowa
Wstaje tak, jak co dzień wstaje
By znów włożyć swe ubranie

Ja podrapie się po głowie
Gdy wiem, że nie dam rady
Na sumieniu zatrę ślady
Majaczy autostrada
Ta noc będzie trwać do rana

Koniec Świata - Mikorason


Nie wiem dokładnie był chyba październik
Spalałem się w piekle jak wszyscy niewierni
Krajobraz nietknięty ten sam dookoła
Przystanek spożywczy boisko i szkoła

Może znów kiedyś pójdziemy do kina
Nie zatrzyma nas wojna i ta przeklęta zima
To kiedyś by mogło się zdarzyć już teraz
Teraz codziennie na rękach umiera

Daj buzi daj buzi daj
Okna powybijanych serc
Drzwi zaciśniętych szczęk
We łbie mi gra mikorason
Od nowa
Raz dwa
Mam stąd siedem lat do piekła
A na skróty dwie godziny
Już nie działam tak jak kiedyś
Zardzewiały mi sprężyny

Co było spaliło się w wielkim pożarze
Przemycam cię w swetrze w myślach cię chowam
Już więcej nie mówię za ciasne są słowa

Daj buzi daj buzi daj
Okna powybijanych serc
Drzwi zatrzaśniętych szczęk
We łbie mi gra mikorason
Od nowa
Raz dwa
Mam stąd siedem lat do piekła
A na skróty dwie godziny
Już nie działam tak jak kiedyś
Zardzewiały mi sprężyny

Koniec Świata - Mizeria

Stoczniowcy ze stoczni
Stają się niewidoczni
Górnicy z kopalni stają się niewidzialni
Hutnicy z huty będą bony będą buty
Coraz więcej histerii
Coraz więcej mizerii
Stoczniowcy ze stoczni
Stają się niewidoczni
Ludzie ze szklanych ekranów
Udzielają nam wywiadu
Ojcowie i matki z zakładów
Którzy nie mają układów
Klimat szpitalnej kawy
Autostrady zaprowadzą do Warszawy
I kiedy stanie w ogniu dom uciekaj bracie stąd, bo strzelają
Miasto udławi się gradem bomb
W pewną zimową noc kontrolowaną
W ruinach, zgliszczach znajdziesz mnie tam gdzie trzymamy broń naładowaną
Stoczniowcy ze stoczni
Zemszczą się na wyroczni
Budapeszt, Praga czy Berlin
Przyjadą czterej pancerni
Ojczyzna będzie za świadka
Mówią, że ziemia to matka
Na grzechów odpuszczenie w ich stronę polecą kamienieYou might also like

Koniec Świata - Mój bóg

1 ContributorMój bóg LyricsMój Bóg pije na umór żadnych nie czyni cudów
Włóczy się po podziemiach niczym bezdomny pies
On jest łajbą dziurawą z kotwicą zardzewiałą
Opuszczoną przyczepą i melodią bez nut
On rozpuszcza mi grzechy w szklance chłodnej uciechy
Gdy nade mną świszcze krzywda, chowam się w jego bliznach
Choć go nie ma to istnieje zawsze wtedy kiedy wierze
Gdy pode mną chrzęści piekło wtulam się w jego wieczność
A on bez zastanowienia
Staje ze mną w płomieniach
Kielich pełen zbawienia
Wylewa mi pod drzwi
Mój Bóg w siebie nie wierzy choć mu bardzo zależy
Aby żył, aby istniał, aby gdziekolwiek był
On zarabia niewiele, już nie ma go w kościele
Przyjdzie czasem tam pod drzwi, czasem uderzy w dzwon
Choć go nie ma to istnieje zawsze wtedy kiedy wierze
Gdy pode mną chrzęści piekło wtulam się w jego wieczność
On stworzony z mych zamierzeń, ze sprzeczności z ostrzeżeń
I z mych grzechów co tak chłoszczą jego plecy do krwi
A on bez zastanowienia
Staje ze mną w płomieniach
Kielich pełen zbawienia
Wylewa mi pod drzwiYou might also like

Koniec Świata - Na moście w Sarajewie

Nie spotkamy się w piekle
Nie spotkamy się w niebie
Spotkać możemy się jeszcze
Na moście w Sarajewie
Rzeka oddycha dzisiaj prędzej
W kieszeniach smutek oraz radość
Wszystko co mam trzymam w ręce
Niedoskonała doskonałość
Samotne oczy przed lustrem
Jedźmy nikt nie woła
Kilometr za kilometrem
Przytulam szybę do czoła
Elektryzują dreszcze
Słowa szeleszczą w rozmowach
Między chodnikiem a krzesłem
Oddycham z tobą od nowa
Noszę ciebie pod swetrem
Powietrze pachnie benzyną
Jesteś bijącym sercem
W epokę zmienioną chwilą
Czarne i słodkie czereśnie
Z drzewa co rośnie za bramą
I jeśli zgasnę przedwcześnie
Będę tuż obok za ścianą

Koniec Świata - Oranżada

Chciałbym się jeszcze powłóczyć z tobą
Póki żyjemy i mam cię obok
Zjechać z tobą w dół po poręczy
Wspólnie się wyczołgać z nędzy
Schować szczęście tu pod podłogą
Zanim przyjadą i nas wywiozą
Zobaczyć razem niebo po burzy
Skoczyć w kałuże żyć jak najdłużej
Siedzę na ławce i patrzę na słońce
Chyba już dzisiaj nigdzie nie zdążę
Chyba już nigdy nie będzie lepiej
Nie będzie dobrze więc się nie spieszę
Chciałbym się jeszcze powłóczyć z tobą
Póki żyjemy i mam cię obok
Poznać wszystkie diabły, anioły
Elfy strzygi i upiory
Błąkać się w obrazach świętych
Spędzić dwie noce u wiedźm przeklętych
Spotkać tego co się boją
Boga ze zrudziałą brodą
Chciałbym się jeszcze powłóczyć z tobą
Póki żyjemy i mam cię obok
Złączyć się jednym przyjemnym dreszczem
Pochodzić razem nocą po mieście
Zimnym zachłysnąć się majem
Siedzieć i patrzeć na nasze tramwaje
Wypić z worka oranżadę
I wyprowadzić się na stałeYou might also like

Koniec Świata - Porąbana noc

Ta porąbana noc i porąbane sny
Znów z łóżka trzeba wstać
I dalej jakoś żyć
Choć czasem nie wiem jak
Życie to stromy głaz
Na który trzeba wejść
By później z niego spaść
Bo wszystko czego chcę
Całe życie być przy tobie
Niech nie zgaśnie nigdy ogień
Który płonie w tobie
Potykam się co krok
Czasami gubię sens
Lecz idę drogą swą
Wiem dobrze gdzie to jest
Gdy droga skończy się
Dalej nie będzie nic
Choć chętnie by się szło
Nie będzie dokąd iść
Gdy rankiem skoro świt
Zawloką mnie pod mur
Aniele Stróżu mój
Pod tym murem ze mną stój
Ta porąbana noc
I porąbany sen
Znów z łóżka trzeba wstać
I zacząć jakoś dzień

Koniec Świata - Piracki rum

Czerwony świt ostre noże pod żebrami
Nie ma stąd ucieczki i z oczu zniknął ląd
Wszystkie czarne diabły do rana piły z nami
Nie wiedzieć nawet jak minął rok
Choć ostry szkwał łamie życie na pół
Czarne diabły strzegą nas i piracki rum
Ta najpiękniejsza pani to butelka rumu
Przy niej gęstnieje noc i spokojniejszy jest sen
I znowu do rana piliśmy na umór
A po nocy zawsze był dzień
Gdzie do diabła jest nasz dom
Sam już tego nie wiem
W żyłach dojrzało wino i sfermentowała krew
Piliśmy cały czas pod robaczywym niebem
I w portach ponurych miast

Jeden do góry drugi w bok
Każdy też własne imię ma
I urodzenia jakiś rok
Jeden do innych równa krok
A drugi idzie byle jak
Trzeci zaś światłem drąży mrok
Czwarty w ciemnościach cały czas
Coś szarpie i szturcha, miażdży mnie
Puste po cukierkach pudełka
Upchane gdzieś na dnie
Jak zgnieciony życia sens
Byle jak i byle gdzie
Daga didu digu daj

Ilu jest winnych tyle kar
Zerwanych jabłek z naszych drzew
Serce rozprasza miłość, czar
Z drugiej komory zieje gniew
Oko za oko ząb za ząb
Ten na około tamten wprost
Jedni łatają stary dom
Drudzy stawiają nowy most

W mej głowie rozstrzelane myśli
I nic nie przyśni się już dziś
A za sumienia murem wojsko
Krwawym sznurem maszeruje w blady świt
W sercu bałagan nieład wicher
W gazetach, co rano i brzask
Stronice pełne są niedobrych liter
I diabli wezmą nas
Ktoś się całuje pod zegarem
Ktoś wiesza się na byle, czym
A nam tu razem pod biało krwawym sztandarem przyszło żyć
Nawet nie zerkam dziś przez okno
Bo nogi zabraniają iść

Śle kartki z Elizejskich Pól

A drugim da sznur
Serce jej popękało nocą na autostradzie
Kiedyś śmiała się częściej dziś uśmiecha się rzadziej
Usta krwawoczerwone a policzki ma blade
I chociaż nie powinna to wygląda już starzej
Serce bić jej przestało w Paryżu wcześnie rano

Na paryskim bruku zostawiała swe ślady

Życie płynie tu niełatwo
Majowa flaga nad klatką
Wieje na spróchniałych ludzi
Pośród domów, gmachów, ulic
A w osiedlowych piwnicach
Zamienionych na kawiarnie
Na pianinie rżną Chopina
Smutne nocą lśnią latarnie
I jeszcze jedna noc
I ten jeden dzień
I tak przez siedem zwykłych dni
Niepewne chwile tak
Przez siedem zwykłych dni
A przez siedem nocy i dni
Gasną oczy milkną wargi
Łatwiej pozbywam się złudzeń
W świecie niehumanitarnym
Wszystkie dziewczęta z fabryki
Nie rozmawiają już z nikim
Tytoniowe blade usta
Nie pytają już o nic
Z wielkich państwowych urzędów
Wyganiają nas z rozpędu

Komunisty czy żołnierza
Kochankowie z supermarketu
Zaszczepieni na miłość i łzy

Najbardziej podły sen
Chciałbym być wesoły tak jak ty

Kąpać się w błękicie twoich żył
Przeglądać w twoich oczach
Znów obudzi nas pierwszy ptaków śpiew
Słońce wejdzie przez okno
Twoje włosy będą pachniały znów

Co dzień moje myśli topią się
W upiornych paranojach
Aby ten najlepszy wybrać cel

Z naszych gór schodzą lawiny
Ciągle budują tamten most
Jeszcze go wznosić nie skończyli
Na tym podwórku już od lat
W tym samym miejscu stoją śmieci
Z tej samej strony wieje wiatr
Dorosły już sąsiadom dzieci
Czas ucieka dzień za dniem
Niewiele się pozmieniało
Czas ucieka dzień za dniem

I inny ktoś jest w kiosku ruchu

Zrobili płatna autostradę

To był najgorszy rok z najgorszych w moim życiu
Ten najczarniejszy mrok usiadł przy mym stoliku
Nie miałem czucia w duszy i satysfakcji z picia
Lecz tylko zdjęcie Twe, to które mam do dzisiaj

Pamiętam jeszcze numer i kolor autobusu
Wsiadłaś na pętli tej obok hurtowni butów
Wiem, że usiadłaś wtedy bardzo blisko szyby
Nigdy niepołączalni jak dwie na torach szyny

Bolek myli mi się z Lolkiem, poniedziałek z wtorkiem
Matka Boska z Wałęsą, Polska z prawdą wyklętą
Bolek myli mi się z Lokiem, poniedziałek z wtorkiem
Matka Boska z Wałęsą, Polska z prawdą wyklętą

Jechaliśmy bez słów fragmentem autostrady
W szybie za blokiem blok i święta jest nienawiść
Z prawej szczekają na nas a z lewej strony krzyczą
W tym żółtym autobusie pędzącym stąd donikąd

Torturowany wstyd na ziemię się wylewa
I nie jest jak ma być, nic nie jest tak jak trzeba
Poręczy chwytam się, wystygłej jak me ręce
I nic nie mówię, bo mi się mówić nie chce

Bolek myli mi się z Lolkiem, poniedziałek z wtorkiem
Matka Boska z Wałęsą, Polska z prawdą wyklętą
Bolek myli mi się z Lolkiem, poniedziałek z wtorkiem
Matka Boska z Wałęsą, Polska z prawdą wyklętą

Nocny Kochanek - Pornolistonosz


Bez przerwy pukam dzień za dniem, choć drzwi stoją otworem
Jak pocisk przez osiedle mknę, rowerem, nie motorem
I znowu narzekają mi, gdy ja tonę w przesyłkach
Że dawno nawet krótki list, nie gościł u nich w skrzynkach

Chociaż nie za wiele płacą mi
Ja i tak do skrzynki wkładam list
Stosunkowo dużo pracy mam
Zazdroszczę sobie sam

Erotyczną pocztę niosę
Jestem pornolistonoszem
Erotyczną pocztę niosę
Jestem pornolistonoszem

Ja powołania słyszę głos, w społecznym działam czynie
A nie jak ten z Afryki gość, z korzeniem w medycynie
Składakiem znów przed siebie gnam, obrobić cały rejon
Miłości znaczek wszystkim dam, odmawiam raczej gejom

Chociaż nie za wiele płacą mi
Ja i tak do skrzynki wkładam list
Stosunkowo dużo pracy mam
Zazdroszczę sobie sam

Chociaż nie za wiele płacą mi

Nocny Kochanek - Romantyczny Książę Metalu


Założyłem płaszcz, odwiedziłem las
Tylko czary, zaspokoją mnie
Wyczytałem z run, metal, gotyk, doom
Moja różdżka, już unosi się

Szum magicznych drzew
Szepcze mi do ucha
Romantyczny bądź
Jeśli chcesz potrzymać ją za dłoń
Znowu słyszę szept
Czuję puszczy ducha
Romantyczny bądź
Jeśli chcesz potrzymać ją za dłoń

Zakochaj się, zakochaj
Zakochaj się, zakochaj
Zakochaj się
Romantyczny książę metalu

Zastawiony stół, wszystko na koszt mój
Karton wina, błyszczy przy gromnicach
I nadzieję mam, świeczek warta gra
Tak bym chciał, zanurzyć się w twych oczach

Nocny Kochanek - Pan Od Tortur


Ciesz się bólem razem z nami
Mówi napis tuż nad drzwiami
Śmieje się, gdy chwyta cię za dłoń
Jest jak jak brutal-erotoman
Przed cierpieniem się nie schowasz
Seans tortur rozpoczyna się

On sprzedaje ci ból
Już cię łańcuchem skuł
Wie, że pragniesz go znów
Pan od tortur
Gdy ci smutno i źle
W rękę telefon weź
0-700 kręć
Pan od tortur
Pan od tortur śle ból

Za minutę 2,40
Grzechem chętnie cię popieści
Pełna satysfakcja, uwierz mi
Ma też swoją stronę w sieci
W weekend na live chacie siedzi
Wkrótce także opcja "cyber-ból"

Pan od tortur
Pan od tortur śle ból

Sznur, kajdanki założone
Dusza, ciało, umysł, płonie
Każdy zmysł na pół rozrywa się
W wielu krajach zbanowany
Chociaż robi to dla kasy
Cieszy się, gdy znów słyszy twój krzyk

On sprzedaje ci ból
Już cię łańcuchem skuł
Wie, że pragniesz go znów
Pan od tortur
Gdy ci smutno i źle
W rękę telefon weź

Nocny Kochanek - Zdrajca Metalu


Weszłeś do pokoju
Gdy słuchałem Slayera
Kazałeś przełączyć
Na Georgea Michaela
Tłumaczysz się głupio
Że nie chcesz podziałów
Horyzont Twój sięga
Poza nurt metalu
Jakiś czas temu to zauważyłem
Czarne koszulki na białe zmieniłeś
A miałem Cię kiedyś, za swojego brata
Słuchaliśmy razem Maidenów i KATa

Obciąłeś włosy
Nie nosisz glanów
Stałeś się dla mnie
Zdrajcą Metalu
Kurtkę skórzaną
Kupioną na raty
Bez żalu oddałeś
Matce na szmaty
Zdrajca Metalu!

Czuję się jak Jarosław zdradzony o świcie
Rytm ciężki już w Twoim sercu nie stuka
Usuwam Cię ze znajomych z facebooka

1 ContributorChodźmy Na Kebab LyricsSądząc od rana po twoich tekstach
Chciałabyś przeżyć w końcu coś ekstra
Zapierający dech w piersiach moment
Ważne by było to poza domem
Chcesz by uczucie wstydu gdzieś prysło
By móc oddawać się w pełni zmysłom
Niepowtarzalnych pożądasz doznań
Dzięki nim lepiej się poznać można
Już wiem kochanie czego ci trzeba
Jestem przy forsie chodźmy na kebab
Krzyczysz wkurzona z nad umywalki
Że wciąż ci śnią się ostre kawałki
Żądasz ode mnie urozmaiceń
Tak by kuszące było pożycie
Tak by spróbować choć raz inaczej
I do poduszki mi co noc płaczesz
Że życie mija a ty nie miałaś
Szansy by poczuć perwersji ciała
Już wiem kochanie czego ci trzeba
Jestem przy forsie chodźmy na kebab
You might also likeMarzysz by kiedyś wracając z pracy
W czynach bezbożnych móc się zatracić
I rozsmakować się w wyuzdaniach
Bez korzystania nawet z tapczana
A obejrzawszy kolejny serial
Pomstujesz głośno, że pikanteria
Naszym stosunkom była nieznana
Bo w tym przeszkadza moja piżama
Już wiem kochanie czego ci trzeba
Jestem przy forsie chodźmy na kebab

1 ContributorChyba Się Zakochałem LyricsŚpiewam Marleya gdy biorę prysznic
Jestem jak sputnik chce się wystrzelić
Usposobienie mam Hary Kriszny
Werwę góralskiej czuję kapeli
W głowie zagościł pełen pure nonsens
Kontakt mam częstszy ze swoim ciałem
Kontakt mam częstszy ze swoim ciałem
Chyba po prostu się zakochałem
Przypalam zupę i gubię klucze
Nieobecnymi oczami wodzę
Przestałem mówić, jedynie mruczę
I już nie dłubię przy samochodzie
Zwracam uwagę na garderobę
Na mandolinie ćwiczę z zapałem
W chwilach zwątpienia trzy pompki robię
Chyba po prostu się zakochałem
Śledzę uważnie to, co w kulturze
Sam zresztą pisać wiersze zacząłem
Namalowałem serce na murze
By później, walić długo w to czołem
Bo moja miłość jest nieszczęśliwa
Na wzajemności szanse mam małe
Nie jest potrzebna prezerwatywa
Bowiem sam w sobie się zakochałem

Świt blady wstaje nad smętnym miastem
Dziś się nie zbudzę, bo już nie zasnę
W głowie harmider, myśli z syfonu
Kiedy po szóstej wracam do domu

Nie pytaj o nic, chcesz to wybaczaj
Ciesz się kochanie, że w ogóle wracam
Nie pytaj o nic, chcesz to wybaczaj
Ciesz się kochanie, że w ogóle wracam

Ludzie w tramwajach do pracy jadą
Więc to nie może być przecież Radom
Gdzie mnie przeniosło? Brak telefonu
Zgubiłem? Skradli? Wracam do domu

Nie pytaj o nic, chcesz to wybaczaj
Ciesz się kochanie, że w ogóle wracam
Nie pytaj o nic, chcesz to wybaczaj
Ciesz się kochanie, że w ogóle wracam

Gdzieś zniknął szalik, nic nie pamiętam
Czy wielkanocne były już święta?
By sobie poradzić z tym muszę znowu
Napić się zanim wrócę do domu

W domu bałagan gmatwa się przyszłość
Myśli się dławią w bezruchu głupio
Przestrzeń wypełnia wszechmocny stupor
Nic jest warte, aby się starać
Życie się toczy tylko, że z dala
W sercu neony emocji gasną
I monotonii ciągnie się pasmo
To jest depresja
Mówię Ci Czesław
To jest totalna depresja
Mówię Ci Czesław Oczy głęboko są nieobecne
Pustka wypełnia świat niebezpiecznie
Tak jakby duszy nagle ubyło
I braknie miejsca na Twoja miłość
To jest depresja
Mówię Ci Czesław
To jest totalna depresja
Mówię Ci Czesław To jest depresja

Poparzeni kawą trzy - Kawałek Do Tańca

Jeszcze trochę do północy
Drink jak zagubiony pocisk
Strzelił mocno mi do głowy
Coraz trudniej się wysłowić
Pić nie zdrowo więc "na zdrowie!"
Bliższy się wydaje człowiek
Serce mi z tęsknoty pęka
Ty przy barze taka piękna
To jest do tańca kawałek
Więc zrób coś ze swym ciałem
Ja się do Ciebie uczepię
I może będzie nam lepiej
Melancholia, bar, papieros
Dobrze, że jestem hetero
Cały wieczór mnie pociągasz
Więc nie mówmy o poglądach
Nie wspominaj o chłopaku
Dziś Warszawa jutro Kraków
Zagubieni w zmysłów sieci
Gdy z głośników przebój leci
Gdy do tańca ciebie proszę
Parkiet staje się kosmosem
Trwa rytmiczna gra przedwstępna
Ciężko kroki zapamiętać
Opętani drżymy w transie
Trzeba wykorzystać szansę
By zatracić się tej nocy
I pokusom dać się stoczyć

Wezmę Cię, bo masz u mnie wzięcie dziś!

A potem będę rozmyślać wciąż
Kiedy Cię będę mógł znowu wziąć
A potem będę rozmyślać wciąż
Kiedy Cie będę mógł wziąć!

Poparzeni kawą trzy - Wybory

1 ContributorWybory Lyrics
Oczy nabrzmiałe od alkoholu
Zdolności małe i gra pozorów
Medialny bełkot
Chamstwo i PR (pi ar)
Byle szabelką móc powywijać

Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami
Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami
Staniemy przed wyborami
Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami

Platforma ochów nad samym sobą
Pisuar fochów co inni robią
Wazeliniarzy świat we frazesach
By nie urazić pana prezesa

Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami
Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami
Staniemy przed wyborami
Nieszczęścia chodzą partiami

Kwiat menażerii pełen kompleksów
Jakby nie mieli od dawna seksu
Choć mają braki i złe pomysły
Właśnie na takich zasłużyliśmy!

Poparzeni kawą trzy - Życie Ułożyć

1 ContributorŻycie Ułożyć LyricsTy wolisz ciuchy, a ja play station
Ty masz nos duży, ja trochę mniejszy
Ty w towarzystwie cała rozkwitasz
Ja głównie siedzę wtedy przy płytach
Ty na komediach rżysz histerycznie
Zwłaszcza gdy ponoć są romantyczne
I z nudów łamiesz te swoje tipsy
Kiedy Cię biorę na science-fiction
Przestań kochanie ciągle mi grozić
Że życie sobie ze mną ułożysz. Dla mnie „Leningrad" to jest muzyka
Ty ograniczasz się do Rubika
Życiową mądrość, wiedzę o świecie
Czerpiesz jedynie z prasy kobiecej
Moi koledzy wszyscy Cię drażnią
Jakby chorobę przeszli zakaźną
Do koleżanek Twoich strach podejść
Nie dość, że brzydkie to już nie młode
Przestań kochanie ciągle mi grozić
Że życie sobie ze mną ułożysz Nie znasz zupełnie się na futbolu
Kochasz się tylko po alkoholu
Ciągle się mądrzysz na każdy temat
Zawsze wiesz lepiej choć racji nie masz

Ty wolisz włóczyć się po solariach
Co rusz odwiedzać to nowe sklepy
I się ode mnie nie chcesz odczepić
Przestań kochanie ciągle mi grozić
Że życie sobie ze mną ułożysz

Poparzeni kawą trzy - Okrutna, zła i podła


Wróciłem wcześniej niż zwykle
Dobrze, że miałem klucz
Szef przywiózł mnie motocyklem
Do ciebie, aż pod Łódź
To miała być niespodzianka
W plecaku kilka win
Cicho wchodzę do mieszkanka
A ty tam w łóżku z nim !

Okrutna, zła i podła
Jak zrobić mi to mogłaś ?
Rzuciłbym cię natychmiast
By moment wykorzystać
Lecz się opamiętałem
Bo gdzie ja z takim ciałem
Znajdę, jak też z chałupą
Kolejną równie głupią

Byliśmy raz na prywatce
Twój widok wzbudzał szał
Staliśmy gdzieś przy sałatce
Z głośników Marley grał
Zostawiłem cię na chwilę
W kuchni dawali gin
Wracam i w serce sztylet
Bo ty w łazience z nim !

1 ContributorMoje Stąd LyricsŁańcuchy wolności ściany nadziei
We wszystkich odcieniach zieleni
Słońce przegląda się dla pewności
Że jeszcze wiele odmieni
Szare wąskie tory obrośnięte olchą
Wiodą życia swoje dokąd im nie wolno
Gdzie na dnie lasu jak na dnie marzenia
Zwalone drzewa śnią drugie istnienia
Siwa mgła we włosach rudawych połonin
Napięte żyłki na zielonej dłoni
W gęstwinach wspomnień serpentyny ścieżek
Granice zielone za którymi leżę
Parują stoki zasiedlone pustką
A czas jak smoluch niе zadba o jutro
Jak przedni orzeł w triumfie nad doliną
Skrzydła rozłożę albo cicho zginę
Siwa mgła wе włosach rudawych połonin
Napięte żyłki na zielonej dłoni
W gęstwinach wspomnień serpentyny ścieżek
Granice zielone za którymi leży

Siedzą misie ze śniadaniem
Każdy w ręku trzyma bełta
Oglądają świat przez szkiełka
I na chwilę wzrok im skrzy się
Z każdym łykiem wraca życie
Słońca promień też zabłysnął
Uda się na ławce przysnąć
Ref
Wino,wino,wino wina za karę
Tak jak czas przepłynął
Przez życie przegrane
Wino,wino,wino surogat pociechy
Za zmarnowany talent
Wina za grzechy
Stoją misie w bramie nocą
Piją bełta i bełkocą
I ja też tak z nimi stałem
Piłem bełt i bełkotałem
Jadą chłopcy z gitarami
Będą walczyć z wiatrakami
A gdy nagle skręci życie
Któryś z nich zostanie misiemYou might also like

My neighbors ask me why I'm limping down the way
And who that fellow was who came by yesterday
I quickly turn my face before I start to blush
'Cause frankly there is nothing I can say
I've always had a thing for pushing the extremes
And I've just got a thing you won't find in the magazines
This molded silicone has got me begging please
Give me more of what I really need

'Cause there is no cock like horse cock
Send your asshole into shock
You need horse cock of course-cock
Grab the lube and slam the day away

My shaft is quivering, my balls are turning blue and
I think of drinking in a foot or even two
My favorite stallion that I keep in my top drawer
Slip it in and out be dripping goo

As I take more cock, horse cock
Shut the door and turn the lock
Is your cock a horse cock?
You will never hear me saying neigh!

Don't stop now, horse cock
Stretch out my insides and make me pray

Zakochany młody chłopak i piękna dziewczyna
Bajery typu spacery, wypady do kina
Wiem, że kiedyś będzie z nich bardzo fajna rodzina
Przy butelce wina siedzą we dwoje na plaży
Możesz nie kojarzyć, ale to są twoi starzy
Życie ułożone, bierze ją za żonę
Studia porobione i wybudowany domek (Łou-ło)
Za moment ta rodzina (Jei-je)
Będzie jeszcze miała syna
Zaczyna się poród, elegancki tato model
Wiezie przyszłą mamę swoim drogim samochodem
Wszystko gotowe, zabierają ją na salę
Zachowują spokój, nie denerwują się wcale
Nie mieści się w pale, żе się zrobi taki gnój
Bo miało być doskonale, a tu kurwa taki chuj

Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie
Martwica macicy, zakażеnie w jajowodzie
Stara umiera, a ty pierdolony płodzie
Zostajesz na lodzie, zostajesz na lodzie
Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie
Martwica macicy, zakażenie w jajowodzie
Stara umiera, a ty pierdolony płodzie
Zostajesz na lodzie, zostajesz na lodzie

Stara zakopana już dwa lata po pogrzebie
Stary chla jak szmata, nie potrafi dojść do siebie
Jebie denaturat, nie ma nawet pięciu złotych
Odkąd napierdolonego wyjebali go z roboty
Upada nisko, chuj wbity we wszystko
Żule na panelach rozpalają wam ognisko
Dziwko, jebana melina
Nieprzytomny stary zarzygany leży w szczynach
Obsrane firany powiewają tu nieśmiale
A za nimi zapomniany głodujący malec
Leży cały w kale, nie przebierają go wcale
Piąty dzień głoduje, oblizuje pusty talerz
Przez wybite szyby wpada chłód, chłód, chłód
Nieporządek i meneli w bród, w bród, w bród
Najebany stary wyszedł, nie zamykał drzwi
A ty zostałeś z żulami sam na parę dni

Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie
Martwica macicy, zakażenie w jajowodzie
Stara umiera, a ty pierdolony płodzie
Zostajesz na lodzie, zostajesz na lodzie
Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie
Martwica macicy, zakażenie w jajowodzie
Stara umiera, a ty pierdolony płodzie
Zostajesz na lodzie, zostajesz na lodzie
Stary cię porzuca, nie wraca piąty miech
Co za jebany pech, chodzi tu plota, że zdechł
Niech to biją kule, w ogóle niezła kaszana
Bo wychowują cię żule jak jebanego tarzana
Oj na-na-na-na, nikt cię nie przytuliii
Zamiast kaszki gerbera skórki po cebuli
Banda żuli – są nieczuli, kiedy tobie leci łza
Gaszą ci szlugi na ryju, traktują gorzej jak psa
Życie bywa trudne podpite opryszki
Robią z ciebie kurwę, żeby zalać pyski
Pedofil cię rucha, zapłacił dwie dyszki
I kurwa po wszystkim nasrał do kołyski
Na pobliskim kocu jeden menel idiota
Zgłodniał pierdolony i gotuje zupę z kota
Chałupa płonie, to jebany koniec, pecie
Wszystko się zjarało no i śmiecie nie żyjecie

Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie
Martwica macicy, zakażenie w jajowodzie
Stara umiera, a ty pierdolony płodzie
Zostajesz na lodzie, zostajesz na lodzie
Zgon przy porodzie, zgon przy porodzie

Michael Bublé - Sway


When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Blondie - Maria


She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
You wanna make her all your own?

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights

Fool for love and fool on fire
Won't come in from the rain

Blue as ice and desire

Lou Bega - Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit of...)


Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me, flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha)

(Ha) Trumpet
The trumpet
Mambo Number 5
Ha-ha-ha
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh)

I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo Number 5 (Ha)

Mark Knopfler - What It Is


Drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air
Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

That's what it is
It's what it is now

Yeah, there's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down
Lights are out in the city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
You might also like
That's what it is
It's what it is now

The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone
And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul

And it's cold on the tollgate
With a Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

That's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now

There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours
On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick for my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell

That's what it is
It's what it is now
It's what it is
What it is now

Cruachan - Ride On

1 ContributorRide On Lyrics
True, you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
Standing sixteen, one or two
With eyes wide and green
And you ride the horse so well
Hands light to the touch
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to

Ride on, see you
I could never go with you
No matter how I wanted to
When you ride into the night
Without a trace behind
Run your claw along my gut, one last time
I turn to face an empty space
Where you used to lie
And look for a spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in my eye

Nocny Kochanek - Dariusz


Odstawiam alkohol i inne używki
Nie kręcą mnie laski, nie kręcą mnie cycki
Mój los dziś napisał mi nowy scenariusz
Historia miłości pod tytułem Dariusz
Od teraz wódeczka już mi nie smakuje
Od dziś myślę głową, nie jak wcześniej…
I liczę po cichu, że namiętność wygra
Choć nie jestem gościem twojego kalibra

Tak chciałbym ciebie uwieść
Myślę nad sposobem
No chyba mi nie powiesz
Że jesteś homofobem
Dariusz
Miłości nie powstrzymasz
Ja kurwa dla ciebie
Przestałem przeklinać
Dariusz
Na zawsze już

A Dariusz na wylot już zna moje teksty
Ten piszę dla niego, więc będzie najlepszy
Szukałem go wszędzie, znalazłem w stolicy
Niech ślubu udzieli nam burmistrz dzielnicy
Więc proszę, dziewczyny, nie piszcie już do mnie
Mnie wasze nudesy żenują ogromnie
Możecie się ubrać, bo mi już nie stanie
Mój pociąg do kobiet odjechał w nieznane

Urszula - Rysa na szkle

Zegar bije już szósty raz
Słońce spada na stół...
Zaraz wejdziesz zapadnę w trans
Obudzi mnie ból...
Sama nie wiem czy tego chcę?
Czasem życia mego mi żal
Rysa na szkle...
Schody w górę i schody w dół
Kto ma klucze do drzwi?...
Kochaj mocno, kochaj mnie
Egoizm na pół
I sama nie wiem czy szukać bram
Do ogrodu, gdzie mieszka NIC...
Czego wciąż mi brak?
Przecież wszystko mam...
Obcy ludzie mówią
Że tak zazdroszczą mi...
Czego wciąż mi brak?
Co tak cenne jest?
Że ta nienazwana myśl
Rysą jest na szkle...
Beznamiętnie podpalam świat
W końcu liczy się gest...
Obracam w palcach zagadkę dnia
Fala bije o brzeg...
Już sama nie wiem czy siebie znam?
Tyle mego, to co się śni

Jaką cenę przyjdzie dać
Za to czego chcę?

Przecież wszystko mam...
Nie zrozumie nigdy mnie

1 ContributorKroplą deszczu Lyrics
Tak to ja – widzisz bywa tak
W zimnym deszczu posłusznie moknę
Za rogiem człowiek – on to lepiej zna
Co znaczy czekać – on tu dłużej moknie
Wpisany w los milczenia łyk
Zapisany wierszem
Poetą mistrz – a błaznem ja
Z datą wczorajszego dnia

Kroplą deszczu namaluję cię
A potem długo sam – sam w to nie uwierzę
Kroplą deszczu spłynie twoja twarz
W tej kropli będę ja – i z sobą mnie zabierzesz

Tak to ja – moim sługą deszcz
Wielkich powstań i upadków mężem
Mrocznych pieśni zapisanych nut
Swoich marzeń otępiałym więźniem
Tak to ja – a przy mnie twoja twarz

Kroplą deszczu namaluję cię
A potem długo sam – sam w to nie uwierzę
Kroplą deszczu spłynie twoja twarz
W tej kropli będę ja – i z sobą mnie zabierzesz

Kiedyś znajdę dla nas dom, z wielkim oknem na świat
Znowu zaczniesz ufać mi, nie pozwolę ci się bać
Kiedyś wszystkie czarne dni obrócimy w dobry żart
Znowu będziesz ufać mi... Teraz spij...
Wiem, dobrze wiem, potrafię ranić tak jak nikt
Przykro mi. Nie wiem, co robić, gdy płaczesz
Już nie śmiejesz się jak kiedyś, wszystko jest inaczej
Kolejny raz proszę cię o ostatnia szansę
Kiedyś znajdę dla nas dom, z wielkim oknem na świat

ABBA - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)


Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

Tina Turner - What's Love Got to Do with It


You must understand, oh, the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me

Toto - Africa


I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh-hoo

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh-hoo

And it's not too long before you point it out

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Kansas - Dust in the Wind


I close my eyes
Only for a moment and the moment's gone
All my dreams
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity

Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song
Just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do
Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind

Ohh-oh-ah


Now, don't hang on
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy

Leonard Cohen - Hallelujah


Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
You might also like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Elton John - I'm Still Standing


You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I’ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, I remember!
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

George Michael - Careless Whisper


Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
Should've known better, yeah


I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
You might also like

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

(Should've known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love

Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone)
Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?

Survivor - Eye of the Tiger


Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

Rising up to the challenge of our rival

The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new

Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

Louis Armstrong - What a Wonderful World


I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I love you"

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I'm beggin' of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Yeah!

Know you by waste and not by your face
Not by introduction, not by handshake
Not by the things that you own, but the things you dispose
It's not a case of theft but a case of loan

Scavenger, have you heard?
I'm sifting through your trash
While I'm gonna make it last, well
Scavenger survivors find a way

Still sticky fingers find sticky situations
But in the wake of swept rugs we all need assistance

So now I'm living off the spoils of leftover generations
Equipped with wit and long legs if I need them
To hold my ground but not be found
I'm quicker than the wind but half as 

Scavenger, have you heard?

While I'm gonna make it last, well

Lorenzo Licitra - Like a Prayer

1 ContributorLike a Prayer Lyrics
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing
 
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
 
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight, we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you

Aether (Metal) - Tale of Fire

For years we've fought
With foes of our Lord
They fell one by one, all glory was ours
No one withstood our sacred willpower
Those times are but gone
Our magic we've lost
As traitor turned his back on the light
Thus broke our vow to serve the fire
Yet from the shade
A hero emerged
He hit the trail and gathered the grails
And all of a sudden our blessing returned
Now reunite
The warriors of light
Those who have crossed frail border of death
The sons of fire, descendants of flame
Fire, light in the mountains and ocean depths
Fill our hearts with your fiery breath
Ravage our fears and bless us with strength
So we'll light up the darkness, oh
Fire, blood of the warriors, seal of their fate
Be our guide in the days of dismay
Carve our paths and straighten our ways
And we'll light up the darkness again

Ancient Bards - Through My Veins


The battle wages on as cruel as it can be
Swords slashing on the shields make sparks that fill the air
No holds barred here I nearly lost my ring
My friends are on the ground it's time for me to hit

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins
A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

Oh how he blows us away!
Oh how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long
We are on our knees!
What a perfect chance for us to be
The glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
Fight him 'til death!

Come on, show me what you've got!

King Rahed has lost his senses, Shena takes her turn
She thinks that killing Sendor will mend her broken heart
My rod's powerless, I don't know what to do
I hope that he won't hurt the woman he once loved

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins
A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

Oh how he blows us away!
Oh how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long
We are on our knees!

What a perfect chance for us to be
The glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
Fight him 'til death!

Come on, show me what you've got!

Sendor screaming out like a demon
Strikes them showing no mercy
Full of hatred and endless fury
He's turned into a monster
Scattered fragments of glass
Bodies lying on the stairs

The battle wages on as cruel as it can be
Swords slashing on the shields make sparks that fill the air
No holds barred here I nearly lost my ring
My friends are on the ground it's time for me to hit

My arms get stronger and stronger
With every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
Through my veins

A god is growing inside me
It feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword

Oh how he blows us away!
Oh how he makes us fall!
We can't last for long

Gojira - Stranded

The first single released from their album Magma, Gojira present a very strong and emotional track with “Stranded”, showing a very different yet similar approach to their classic sound.
A growing sickness in the heart
Defective, lack of control
The cure is somewhere in the silence
But I'm crushed by the noise inside

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of me falls for you

Another day in the dark
No, no
Stranded in the night
Stranded in the cold

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me, face down, dead
Another day in the dark

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of you gone to waste
Please hear me out
You kill me, face down, dead
Another day in the dark

Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone

Kataklysm - The Black Sheep


Blood for blood, eye for an eye
Let my vengeance reign the sky
Let it rain, feel its pain
I’m the catalyst of your demise
If it breathes, it lies, if it bleeds, it dies
I’ll cut you open from the inside
Restless in a world that’s shameless
The slaves are endless

Hold me down, push me away
Sentence me and bury me alive
I’ll never be like you, I won’t conform
I’ll never change, I’m the black sheep

Your face to the ground, don’t make a sound
How does it feel to be losing your crown
All of the sins you say I committed
Are all of the sins that you have admitted
Hate me for all the things that you couldn’t be
Fear me forever
All the poison you put in my head
All the rage you’ve written instead
All your attempts to murder my soul, murder, murder
Fuck you all
I’m still alive!

You got the noose around my neck
You got the rope to see me dead
But I won’t go away, I won’t fade away
I won’t be the one in disarray
It’s all lies, for them to rise
They want to see me fall in line
Like a sheep for slaughter, a clown for laughter
Controlled order

In this world you better live for something
Or you going to die for nothing

Hold me down, push me away
Sentence me and bury me alive
I’ll never be like you, I won’t conform
I'd rather die, I’m the black sheep

Lorna Shore - Of the Abyss


Misbegotten world
Inconsequential fate
Accept your prophecy
We rot face down
Burning in silence
We fought in the ground
Desponding violence

Stellar rebirth
Erase mistakes from the past
When we break from the trance
From the grave we're unmasked
And escape into the jaws of the beast
We are unleashed

From the carcass of a dead star
To thе darkness of a blackened hеart
We are one in the dust, in the nothingness
We are infinite, we are infinite
Misbegotten children of the abyss
We are infinite, we are infinite

We rot face down
Burning in silence
We fought in the ground
Desponding violence

Stellar rebirth
Erase mistakes from the past
When we break from the trance
From the grave we're unmasked
And escape into the jaws of the beast
We are unleashed

From the carcass of a dead star
To the darkness of a blackened heart
We are one in the dust, in the nothingness
We are infinite, we are infinite
Misbegotten children of the abyss
We are infinite, we are infinite

Flawed by design
We were born to die again and again
Mindless creations
Malfeasance of the father
Pray to imitation gods
You fell with me
Now see it all
A lesson in suffering

From the carcass of a dead star
To the darkness of a blackened heart
We are one in the dust, in the nothingness
We are infinite, we are infinite
Misbegotten children of the abyss
We are infinite, we are infinite

Misbegotten world
Inconsequential fate
Accept your prophecy

Mors Principium Est - Lost in a Starless Aeon


I was trapped in a game that I never played
What is my purpose? What is my destiny?
A game is for fools, there are no rules
I'll cheat this life, you will see soon
That I am not your soul to test
I'll find the edges of this maze
And finally, I'll put to rest
The emptiness that haunts my days

You have made this world below
The shadow of a dream
My shadow is not for sale
Not for sale
So this is my last goodbye
This is goodbye
My last farewell

Drifting through time
Drifting through time and space
I was drifting through time
Laughter used to fill my days
But now, only sorrow knows my name

I am lost in a starless aeon

This endless path before me
Searching for the end
An empty void surrounds me
Now I descend
I can't escape this darkness
Into the sun
I fly and though I'm lost
This game I won

You have made this world below
The shadow of a dream
My shadow is not for sale
Not for sale
So this is my last goodbye
This is goodbye
My last farewell

Drifting through time
Drifting through time and space
I was drifting through time
Laughter used to fill my days
But now, only sorrow knows my name

Again, again
Again you try to find me
You seek the one
Not willing to be found

Pyramid God
Unlike the places you have been
I'm not confined by lines

Pyramid God, I am the dreamer of this realm
God, but not the dream inside
Pyramid God, I am the head outside the dream
God, I am the headless mind!

Are you, are you
Are you a breath of mine?
You cross my gates
The gates of space and time

Pyramid God
Am I the user of the gates?
I live a triangle life

Pyramid God, I am the dreamer of this realm
God, but not the dream inside
Pyramid God, I am the head outside the dream
God, I am the headless mind!

Build me a monument
New age conspirators
Expand my theories
To a world without end

Build me a monument
New age conspirators
Expand my theories
To a world without end

The Pyramid, the Pyramid
The Pyramid God is watching
The Pyramid, the Pyramid
The Pyramid God is watching

Build me a monument
New age conspirators
Expand my theories
To a world without end

Kalmah - The Black Waltz


And she walks her way so treatled
Leads away from the bless she earned
Gone away the meaning
Before the day, against the morning
Down the path of blind souls she walks
Through the dreams of mystery
Trying to reach the touch of human
Finds the way to the secret lands

Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts
Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts

Hymn of temptation keeps calling
Makes her to believe the dream
She wants to lay to rest
And to take away her veil
Soon will feel the touch of the taker
And will see the eyes of the caller
Can't resist the feeling
Hand in hand they'll fall into sleep

Dancing with me
Forever, the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever, the black waltz


Dancing with me
Forever, the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever, the black waltz

Insomnium - Flowers of the Night


Wondrous gleam of the summer night
Sneaks in through the window pane
I hear the cuckoo's calling
As I lay by her side

By the grace of the one true God
By the providence of Christ
I have found the golden maiden
I have found the fairest one
I will fold her into my arms
I will wipe away her tears
I will keep her safe from all the harm
Forevermore

The flowers of the night
Only open up to the dark
I hear them whispering
As I lay by her side

How did I deserve this mirth?
How did I find this bliss?
Hallowed glow will shine upon her brow
Forevermore

But the colder winds will rise
And the autumn gloom awaits
For the seed inside won't grow
No child is on the way
The winter of despair
And the silence of the nights
Slowly will take their toll
Slowly will freeze our hearts

With tears in her eyes
She repeats the mother's words
Even the hounds will bark
When such a thing is near
Salt-ridden is this soil
And shriveled is the womb
A stain on our good name
Forevermore


The flowers of the night
Only open up to the dark
I hear them whispering
As I lay by her side

By the grace of the one true God
By the providence of Christ
Have I found the golden maiden?
Have I found the fairest one?
I will fold her into my arms
I will wipe away her tears
I will keep her safe from all the harm
Forevermore

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh, my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh, my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go


Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh, my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye
I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Get outta my head, 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this?
But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

And it waits for you

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

Skyfire - Liberation in Death

1 ContributorLiberation in Death LyricsThe constant search ended up today
Settled down for the easiest pray
Extinguished silently
Trespassing the verge of lunacy
'Til nothing remains the same
An act of shame
This design isn't meant to be
Destined to abuse
Nothings safe
Iteration
Until liberation in death
Is it worth waiting for?
Not necessary broken
But something's wrong deep inside
An aberration impossible to hide
And it is shining through
Another life taken away
Led astray
Not necessary broken
But something's wrong deep inside
An aberration impossible to hide
And it is shining through
A life wasting away

Naglfar - The Mirrors of My Soul


I was alone, blinded, unaware
Then their voices came near, now inside my mind they're always there
Telling me what to say and do
Guiding my path, carrying me trough
Now my words cut like blades of anger
Gospels of the night, sung under the northern light
The thing that once was me is no more human inside
I am lost, I am dead yet alive

My eyes, they mirror my soul
Black, empty, senseless and cold
I've lost the lust for life, leave me alone
I will exit this existence, I am going home

For me there's no tomorrow, for me there's no today
My work is done, I will walk away

Deeper into darkness, deeper I fell
When I close my eyes I see myself burn in hell
Anointed in blood, crowned by the damned
The tongue of doom, forever I am

I am a demon, an angel, the voice of the insane
Messenger of light and bringer of pain
When my inner voice command I obey
It controls me, like a master his slave

My eyes, they mirror my soul
Black, empty, senseless and cold
I've lost the lust for life, leave me alone
I will exit this existence, I am going home

For me there's no tomorrow, for me there's no today
My work is done, I will walk away

Then their voices came near, now inside my mind they're always there

I am lost, I am dead yet alive

I've lost the lust for life, leave me alone
I will exit this existence, I am going home

Beweint das Leid, beklagt den Tod und eure große Not
Bei Tag und Nacht jagt es unser Blut
Nun zahlen wir dem Tod Tribut
Ein Heer der Toten ist seine Fracht
So wirds getragen durch die Nacht
Wenn schwarze Segel am Horizont
Ist es Naglfar, niemand entkommt
Ein Heer der Toten ist seine Fracht
So wirds getragen durch die Nacht

Im Schein der Nacht den Tod entfacht

Naglfar - Harvest

Behold the crown of creation
Worthy of nothing but scorn
Failed abortions that never
Should have been born
Liars
Two-faced, spiteful and vile
Your true self well hidden behind
A poisonous smile
Deceiver
No deed shall go unnoticed
Unpunished nor be undone
The hope for reprisal is what
Makes my body go on
Kind words that reek of betrayal
From tongues that drip of lies
One hand reached out while the other
Is hiding a knife
Deceit for a lifetime has taken its toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown

Scum
I detest all of your kind
Forever you'll be the greatest travesty
The essence of humanity
You failure
The equivalent of slime
A tragic breed, not more than a disease
So stay away from me
Deceit for a lifetime has taken its toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown
This harvest is heavy and bitter it seems
In tainted soil it has grown
These words are its venom and my gift to thee
So choke on them now and leave me be
A sorry excuse for a human
A complete and utter disgrace
Not having the courage to speak up to my face
Deceit for a lifetime has taken its toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown
This harvest is heavy and bitter it seems
In tainted soil it has grown
These words are its venom in its purest form
So choke on them now, yes harvest the storm

Aephanemer - The Sovereign

Always over hill and dale
A wanderer walking in strides
Restlessly hitting the trail
On the dark or the sunny side
Keeping on a steady pace
Without leaving any trace
Used to nature of progress
A lot of well directed steps
Haunting the fields and the woods
Rather than the doors of men
Attending to his own moods
As a wilderness denizen
With a feeling soon renewed
Kind of withered over time
A severed stem far from its roots
Though blooming during his climb
Creeping in, the cold
Invades his inner stronghold
The icy quiver running through his bones
Reminds him suddenly that he was gone
For way too long
Too far, alone

Wherever this one is traveling
Welcomed, expected or despised
By a fireside or a chilling wind
Even-tempered, such is the wise
Not a beggar, to stay when spurned
He can't be drawn in any strife
And never got his fingers burned
By possessions, such is his life
Good-natured like the stray cat
A sense of gratitude for his beloved independence
When done with society, he’s taking a step back
Just goes off quietly somewhere by himself
Surveyor of human soul
Monarch of lands that lies fallow
Honored of all he must not do against his will
And rich with all that he can afford to drop out of his hands
Most rewards are expensively sold
For attendance, curtsies and praise
Most properties are not worth this pile of gold
Gauged in time, measured in precious days
Growing, the annoyance
Abrades his inner balance

The many frictions disturbing his mind
Weaken his detachment, strengthen his view
To stay aloof
From humankind
Wherever this one is traveling
Welcomed, expected or despised
By a fireside or a chilling wind
Even-tempered, such is the wise
Not a beggar, to stay when spurned
He can't be drawn in any strife
And never got his fingers burned
By possessions, such is his life
Good-natured like the stray cat
A sense of gratitude for his beloved independence
When done with society, he's taking a step back
Just goes off quietly somewhere by himself

Pulling everyone down with me

Pulling everyone down with me

Pulling everyone down with me

Woah!

So goddamn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
The laughingstock of your own fucking stage

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

Just one time, you got a reason
Heard you had nothing to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me


You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets any more true
So, close your eyes once more
And once more believe
That they all still believe in you

Just one time

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

Just one time
You try me
Just one time
You try me
You try me

Meshuggah - Bleed

The initial title for this track stood as “aneurysm,” and as follows, the lyrics describe Thomas Haake’s conception of transfiguration from life to death via hemorrhaged vessel within the skull.
According to… Read More 
Beams of fire sweep through my head
Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
I'm no one now, only agony
My crimson liquid so frantically spilled
The ruby fluid of life unleashed

Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self
The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom

Malfunction, the means for its ascent
Bloodletting the stringent voice to beckon my soul

So futile, any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth

The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained

"Heed," it commands
"Heed my will"
"Bleed," it says
"Bleed you will"


Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Mind's eye flickers and vellicates as I let go
Taunting whispers accompany my deletion

A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper
Chanting softly the song of depletion

Zico Chain - Mercury Gift

Swim my pisces
And play these immense oceans apart
Let this heart speak
And sleep sweet Jesus
You're overwelmed, burdened, this defeat
Don't you work in mysterious ways?
Have faith, have faith, I'll never let you down
Have faith, have faith, faith, faith, faith, FAITH!
Heaven isn't waiting for the better you
Silence the fear in your heart
Nothing but a crash if you don't pull through
Sanctioned to tear us apart
It's the passion that keeps us alive
I'M NOT GONNA RUN!
Stars at sundown
Your trails like smoke
Drawer in the skies
Free my mind
Dream what it once was
Reminisce every day
How we lived
For the memories of a lifetime

Have faith, have faith, I'll never let you down
Have faith, have faith, I'll never let you down!
Heaven isn't waiting for the better you, (Hold me back!)
Silence the fear in your heart
There's nothing but a crash that awaits you
And they're not gonna tear us apart
It's the passion that keeps us alive
I'M NOT GONNA RUN!
Walk like this
Tear these old walls down
Reminisce
Nothing matters now
Walk like this
Tear these old walls down
One last gift
Nothing matters now
I'd like to run
I'd like to learn
In the end
I'd like to run
I'd like to learn
In the end

In the end
I'm not gonna run
In the end
You know, heaven can wait
In the end
I'm not gonna run
Nothing matters now
Heaven can wait!

1 ContributorMalady X LyricsOvercome by distaste
My eyes bleed, turn into black
Abandoned by the gods – left behind
No one wants to realize
We drown ourselves in gloss and shine
Disclaim our virtues for our pride
Me and I, devil-may-care
Future is dead and present means hell
The world turns black
If you like curiosity
Come inside and take your seat
Forget about morality
Just believe!
Welcome to the show
Malady superabounds
Open your eyes and see
The insane reality
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss
Malady superabounds
Welcome to the show
A society on burned ground – soaked in blood
Fear thy neighbor, god is dead
We are sick in many ways – countless
No one wants to realize
We gloat over agony – mortal fear
On the wings of the weak we fly
Stitch up my lips and seal them well
If you don't wanna hear the truth

Welcome to the show

Open your eyes and see
The insane reality
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss

Welcome to the show
This world is a cage
No escape
Better not be weak
You can't flee
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss
Welcome to the show
It's better to forego
Open your eyes and see
This is reality
Open your eyes and see

Dark Oath - Land of Ours

At last the time has come
For us to set sail with honour and pride
To conquer richness and land
May the gods bless us with glory
We set sail
Hoping to be victorious
Hoping to come back safe and sound
And see that land of ours
We set sail
Carrying allfather's pride with us
Hoping to come back safe and sound
And see that land of ours
Arriving the foreign shore
We hunt for villagers and take their town
Letting their leader acknowledge our arrival
Taking away their lives and lore
Spilling blood throughout their land
We conquer and spread out our glory
Making women and priests our slaves
We ravish everything in sight

We set sail
Hoping to be victorious
Hoping to come back safe and sound
And see that land of ours
We set sail
Carrying allfather's pride with us
Hoping to come back safe and sound
And see that land of ours
As the bloodshed stops we load our ships
And ready ourselves before the journey we face
But little we know that this journey of ours
Will not be as easy as the Gods promised us
With fury and might the waves torment us
Keeping the path away from our sight
By the shore we arrive surviving the menace
Only to notice we wander away
Long ago we took the path
To return to our land
Through the cold snow we all march
Hoping to reach home someday
We wander away through the frozen woods
The lone mountains and icebound rivers
We pray to the gods for their merciful help
So that we see again that land of ours

Long ago we took the path
To return to our land
Through the cold snow we all march
Hoping to reach home someday
Long ago we took the path
To return to our land
Through the cold snow we all march
Hoping to reach home someday
At last, the trail to get home alive
Is getting brighter at each step we make
We only have the gods to thank for this ending
And make sure the deed is redeemed
Meat and Mead to welcome us all
And reward us from this frightening quest
That journey across the sea that we endured
Just to see that land of ours

The Duskfall - Shoot It In

A change was made today, somehow the reason got lost along the crooked way
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made
Remain still and enjoy the ride, right into your goddamn graves...
Seeking so desperatly for nothing at all, tasting every drop of rain
Without daring to look, you´re turning every stone
Generation cold and dead...
Move on in and let them forcefeed the weak, the divine gets them on their knees
You preach about doomsday, you differ from me
Shoot it in, this is what they seek, the divine gets them on their knees
You give them hope, I just set them free - Your truth is not for me
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made
Stand still, obey them now, remain without a single sound...
Fighting so violently for a useless cause, beating down the so called insane
Without daring to look, you´re turning every stone
Generation, we should have known...

"For evil to triumph it only takes good men to do nothing"

Piece by piece
Limb by limb
Hear the screams of a dying world
Everything you bring smells of decay

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a state of confusion
Hate
You build on you hate
As you lay under the guillotine

Stone by stone
Strength by strength
Your betrayal is monumental
Hiding through the cracks of fear
I see you dying

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a different dimension
Greed
It's all about your greed
As you die under the guillotine

Heads will roll
Justice served

Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a state of confusion
Hate
You build on you hate
As you lay under the guillotine
Because you
You let me down
Deep down in a different dimension

Bleed From Within - I Am Damnation

They can't keep dragging us down
We fought tooth and nail to get here
No, they can't keep dragging us down
We are the ones they fear
They can't keep dragging us down
We fought tooth and nail to get here
No, they can't keep dragging us down
We are the ones they fear
Fight it
Back again, once more round the sun still breathing
You know you'll never see the end of this
There's a grave with your name I'm still digging
I've seen the sins, you made the list
So be careful what you say to me
Because I've got no limits
Just an axe to grind
True spirit like this is hard to find
We were taught to believe
They put a price on our dreams
I'm sick of it all
In front of us
A statue of trust
Yet still I fear the worst
For I am damnation

Incompetent, the way I used to view myself
But now I see the world for the way it is
So here I stand before you all
With a point to prove
And nothing to lose
So be careful what you say to me
Because I've got no limits
Just an axe to grind
I found solace in the struggle, a reason to live
Now this is all that's left of me
Now this is all that's left of me
It feels like I'm marching to the edge of the earth
Transcending illusions that have held me for years
Acceptance of the life I've led
Breaking out of my head
This is my world
The kingdom of death
They can't keep dragging us down
We fought tooth and nail to get here
We were taught to believe
They put a price on our dreams
I'm sick of it all
In front of us
A statue of trust
Yet still I fear the worst
But this is where I belong
For I am damnation
Fight it

Fleshgod Apocalypse - The Egoism

Scream for the shame of your ego
To dominate it
Reflecting fear unsatisfied
To kill
Lost in the maze of a treason
Intoxicated
Destined to suffer from mental insanity
Dark is the dream of your demons
Revealing will to subjugate
They need to dominate the men
Crubs will remain on their own table
A solitary king
Forever craving hate
Your reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create your indifference!
They will fear your coming
The selfish dogma
There is no sharing in your life
You feel lost in the haze of oblivion
You're self addicted
Destined to twist all the rules of humanity

Minds are deranged for your sentence
Your domination is a perception of your deception
There is no one to sacrifice that's your oppression
Dust will remain on you
A misanthropic king
Forever craving hate
Your reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create their indifference!
Si vitam inspicias hominum, si denique mores, cum culpant alios: quia nemo sine crimine vivit
Discriminate to enfeeble
It's your intention
The pandemonium in your head
You set all of your goals for your reason
To rise your banners
Moved by the wind of a twisted obscenity
Thorned is the crown of your falseness
It's scraping your skin
As you will worship your own I
Obey!
Mud will be food for your hunger
That brings you under
A mandatory king

Forever craving hate
Your reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create their indifference!

Never pariah but always on one's own
Unwavering mind, black heart rebellion

Cold is the night for the ones born of shadows
Solemn is the way for the ones never restless
Cold is the night for the ones drawn to darkness
Desolate is the path, the path of self-believers

Never bow to anyone;
Never give in
Never surrender to anyone;
Never go astray
Never bow to anyone;
Never give in
Never surrender to anyone;
Never go astray

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Lies...
Lies will bend the minds of the weak
Life...
Life is meant to be led, not followed

Lonely is the road for the ones seeking the truth
Bleak is the trail leading to perception
But only knowledge can cure the blindness
And only knowledge can open our eyes and make us see

Never bow to anyone;
Never give in
Never surrender to anyone;
Never go astray

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Light your torch, your radiant crown
Dress the sky in ever-cold silver
Unshroud the sphere from the clouds

Kanonenfieber - Der Maulwurf



Zum Einsatz als Mineur unter Tage geschickt
Ich dacht mir, da ist man vor Granaten geschützt
Die dreihunderteinundzwanzigste Mineur-Kompanie
Fünfzig Meter über uns herrscht an der Front Manie
Wir graben zwölf Stunden, zwölf Stunden zum Ruh'n
Doch ich kann beim Gewummer kein Auge zu tun
Ich wart' nur, bis der Stollen die Granate erhält
Und wenn's nicht der Feind schafft, dann mach' ich es selbst

Graben
Und weiter graben
Mit meinеm Spaten
Der Maulwurf sieht kеin Licht
Graben
Und weiter graben
Stets unter Tage
Bis der Stollen endlich einbricht

Vier Männer im Schleppschacht bilden eine Schicht
Einer, der den Ton mit dem Spaten absticht
Einer hält ihm den Sandsack auf
Die anderen zwei bringen den Dreck hinauf
Eine Karbidlampe spendet uns Licht
Obendrein schwarzen Qualm, der in der Brust sticht
Im Sauerstoffmangel invalide geplagt
Ich schwör's, nicht mehr lang und ich schieße mich ab

Graben
Und weiter graben
Mit meinem Spaten
Der Maulwurf sieht kein Licht
Graben
Und weiter graben
Stets unter Tage
Bis der Stollen endlich einbricht

Spatenstich an Spatenstich
Nur Wasser und Erde, für uns gibt's kein Tageslicht
Spatenstich an Spatenstich
Offene Hände und Knie, sie plagen mich
Spatenstich an Spatenstich
Seit zwei Jahren jeden Tag zwölf Stunden Arbeitsschicht
Spatenstich an Spatenstich
Nur ein weiterer Tag und ich werde wahnsinnig

Ich atme den Ruß ein und spuck' morgens schwarz
Als ob ich im Krieg nicht genug Sorgen hab'
Die stete Luftknappheit bringt Krankheit im Geist
Da passiert's, dass im Dunkeln manch Gedanke entgleist
Es wummst und es wackelt, ein Minenaufschlag
Nur Sekunden später gibt die Grabenwand nach
Unterbreche fürs Letzte den grabenden Trott
Und press' mir apathisch die 08 an den Kopf

Graben
Und weiter graben
Mit meinem Spaten
Der Maulwurf sieht kein Licht
Graben
Und weiter graben
Stets unter Tage
Bis der Stollen endlich einbricht

Ich erwachte im Lazarett, und zu allergrößtem Schmerze

Bleed From Within - Hands of Sin

I'm in hell
Fire surrounds me
Dragged here kicking and screaming
Not where I need to be
Demons are making moves on me
I aim to kill
But you wear it well
Beneath the broken
I have awoken
Our parting token
Foundations gone
Tear down the enemy of one
Stood on the outside, I'm looking in
Holding peace in hands of sin
This moral mind wears a second skin
The end is now where I begin
Arise
Beneath me, a familiar face
One fallen far from grace
A trail of shattered hearts
Never thought you'd go this far

Bound by torment
But we hide it well
Years of emotion
Severed and broken
A parting token from you
Stood on the outside, I'm looking in
Holding peace in hands of sin
This moral mind wears a second skin
The end is now where I begin
Fading out of form
I feel a hatred in me reborn
I will never be the fucking same
I will never be the fucking same
Foundations gone
Tear down the enemy of one
Stood on the outside, I'm looking in
Holding peace in hands of sin (In hands of sin)
This moral mind wears a second skin
The end is now where I begin
(I will never be the fucking same)

Holding peace in hands of sin (In hands of sin)
The end is now where I begin
Arise

On the seek for the glaring light
On the hunt to morph the night
It ravens all and everyone
Like dark matter, you are the sun

It's a creature mean and pale
Entirely weak, fully insane
And only through external shine
It reaches power and might

1…can you see it crawl?
2…on the seek to slay all light
3…can you hear it crawl?
4… until you are dead

Inside, no glaring fire, no warming flame
Deep inside, merely coldness, merely hate
I hate you!

If you are then weak and pale
It's will be done and your shine gone
Stolen light is highly frail
Your decay is what remains

But they're wearing masks, demons in disguise
Is there nothing we can do?
Is there a way to solve our lives?

And all hope dies

Despair in ice and snow

With all these lies death will come
Broken bodies lay scattered at the ground
Corrupt political plans cut wounds into the skin
Nobody can stop the man with gold in his mind
Is here someone who can help?
Is there a way to stop this war?
Since thousands of years we bring desolation and death
Since the beginning of time we tell you lies
Since thousands of years we bring agony and pain
Since the beginning of time you are our slave
And we are the war

They preach peace and lead war
They kill their brothers for some land
There is no truth and no grace
Profit is the God and spoil the follower

The years go by and
Time is running like a river flows
Never to stop
The leaves are
Falling down these days
And I remember what I've lost
As I said goodbye to you
Can't know it was
The last farewell
So much to say
So much to tell
It was the last farewell...
Asking you how, asking you why
When I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
Your way to the stars
And I never will
Forget who you are
Asking you how, asking you why
When I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
Your way to the stars
And I never will
Forget who you are

I was devastated as I heard
You gone away
Saw in your white cold face
No more time to stay
You told me how to live
You showed me how to fight
I always look up to you
I always be with you
I always look up to you
Asking you how, asking you why
When I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
Your way to the stars
And I never will
Forget who you are
Asking you how, asking you why
When I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
Your way to the stars
And I never will
Forget who you are

Betontod - Traum von Freiheit


Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo!
Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo!

Ich traf dich in den Straßen
In dieser einen Nacht
Die ganz normale Menschen ändert
Und zu Rebellen macht
Du hörst den Ruf nach Freiheit durch die Stille halln'
Siehst der Masse ins Gesicht
Du hast die Faust geballt, hältst den Atem an
Hier kämpft Wahrheit gegen Pflicht

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel
Dieser Traum von Freiheit wird in Erfüllung gehn'
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehn'

Zwischen Rauch und Nebelschwaden
Scheint im getrübten Licht
Dein Ideal von Freiheit
Du siehst der Wahrheit ins Gesicht
Du reißt dich los von alten Zwängen
Gehst diesen einen Schritt
Wenn alle Zweifel fallen und zur Gewissheit werden
Gibt es kein Zurück

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel
Dieser Traum von Freiheit wird in Erfüllung gehn'
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehn'

Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo!
Ooohooohooo, ooohooohooo!

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel
Dieser Traum von Freiheit wird in Erfüllung gehn'
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehn'
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehn'
Wird unser Traum von Freiheit in Erfüllung gehn'

Carrion - Wonderful Life

1 ContributorWonderful Life LyricsHere I go out to sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere
Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
The sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there
And I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

Civil War - Rome is Falling

Rome is Falling is a song about the fall of Rome in 476 AD from the perspective of a Roman Soldier fighting to defend his glorious Rome.
It's time to march
It's time to march again

You and I will last forever
But there are many reasons why I can not stay
Now we shall meet again in heaven
Going out to war is never easy, that is true
Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
The only good thing in my life

A battle cry, a soldier's sigh, I wish I hadn't said goodbye
This time I won't be coming home
In the heat of the fight I search for the light
A rainbow is painting the sky
I am destined now to die

I'm here to march against the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again

Now I'm writing you this letter
But I'm not sure if you will ever see these words

Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
But I'm still aiming for the sky
In this suburb to hell I'm living to tell
About how I defended my Rome
Hail the Caesar Kingdom come

I'm here to march against the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again


I'm here to march against the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I'm here to march against the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again

Rising again, rising again, rising again
Rising again, again, again, again, again
Rising again, my Rome is falling

Dark The Suns - The Sleeping Beauty

I cannot close my eyes
I'm watching sleeping beauty
The world without the fear
The world without the pain
Tonight there are no tears, no cry
Tonight there are no painted smiles, tonight
There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty
Tonight your voice is calling again
Everything is so perfect, you are here tonight
I buried you deep in my heart
And now our fate becomes one
There is a ghost on the sun
When night has fallen on the ground
Angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

Days Of Jupiter - Bleed


Now I'm just a man with the perfect crime
Time and time again, perfect alibi
Life seems so different in my eyes
So, now I
Scream, for a life of eternity
And I'm just an unknown mystery
And I cannot tie to all this misery
So, now I
Scream! (Life will make you)

Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality

Now fight, for the meaning in your life
Crime isn't the answer for you now
And hide all the pieces in your life
Make up your
Mind, you can be who you wanna be
And find a way to peace and serenity
Slide, to the ways of reality
So why do you
Scream (Life will make you)

Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality

Scream
Scream
Scream
Now you scream
So now you scream
So now you bleed

Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality

Take another bite from reality

Eisregen - Elektro Hexe

Um 18 Uhr und 37
Da holt die kleine Hexe Reisig
Sie baut einen Besen draus -
Und fliegt nackig durch das Haus
Komm, hol die Antennen raus
Und flieg dann zum Fenster raus
Hey, hey, Elektro-Hexe
Ferngesteuert und mobil
Hey, hey Elektro-Hexe
Weil dich keiner haben will
Sie hat kleine Schuhe an
Damit sie besser landen kann
Auf der Hexenlandebahn
Mit ihrem Kopf aus Marzipan
Komm und nimm noch mal Anlauf
Und lande dann hart auf mir drauf
Hey, hey, Elektro-Hexe
Ferngesteuert und mobil
Hey, hey Elektro-Hexe
Weil dich keiner haben will

Jetzt kommt der Solopart
Ficken, ficken, ficken, ficken, ficken, ficken, ficken, ficken
Am Arsch ein Höhenmessgerät
Damit fliegt sie auch nachts ganz spät
Das zeigt ihr brav die Richtung an
Damit sie auch mal saufen kann
Komm, steck mir die Antennen rein
Für dich bin ich auch gern ein Schwein
Hey, hey, Elektro-Hexe
Ferngesteuert und mobil
Hey, hey Elektro-Hexe
Weil dich keiner haben will
Ich bau dir einen Scheiterhaufen
Den kann ich mir im Aldi kaufen
Dann zünde ich dich schön mit an
Und schmelzen tut der Marzipan
Ich brech dir die Antennen ab
Und werf dich in ein Hexengrab
Hey, hey, Elektro-Hexe
Ferngesteuert und mobil
Hey, hey Elektro-Hexe
Weil dich keiner haben will

The situations are irrelevant now
She loves the way that I tease
I love the way that she breathes

I touched her (Ooh), she touched my (Ah), it was the craziest thing
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me
A certain girl, she took my hand and ran it up her thigh
She licked her lips and pulled my hair, I'd fall in love for a night

She can't behave, and I'm just a slave
Don't worry, I'll be gone when the morning comes

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion

The frustration it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me
A certain girl, she took her hand and put it in my lap
It's way too— (Fuck)
She said, "Once you have me you'll always come back"

She can't behave, and I'm just a slave
Don't worry, I'll be gone when the morning comes

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion

I know you love to resist
And all it takes is a kiss, and you just love to hate me
You know you love all the lies
So don't act surprised
That I just love to hate you

I kissed your lips, you pulled my hair, it was the craziest thing
I love the girls who love to hate
(Woah)

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion
Darling (Leave me), what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me (Darling), go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your favorite passion

Frogge - Enchanted Crystal Railroad


Oh yeah

We are riding on enchanted crystal railroads
With a treasure made of shining gold and jewels
Liberated by the frogs of far horizons
Over forest realms amphibians will rule

To the ponds and to the trees
Further than anyone has seen
In the Land of Frogs on the mighty logs we will arise
We hail to the swampy gods
To ancient frogs we sacrifice
And seek the power of the treasure horde

We fight for the frogs who came before us
The frogs will bе our guide
The wizard shark now blocks the way
I see him in my drеams
We ride the enchanted crystal railroad
Frog lanterns in the night
Across the mountains and the seas
Frogs will set you free

Beware, brave frogs
For a treacherous path lies ahead of you
The Wizard Shark of Zel-Kathrion seeks to steal your enchanted treasure

We are fighting with a wizard shark so mighty
On a railroad in the mountaintops of hell
Psychedelic magic potions will protect us
Lick the skin and you'll be there one day as well

There's a force inside of me
That will reveal my destiny
To unlock its power you must be set free

We fight for the frogs who came before us
The frogs will be our guide
The wizard shark now blocks the way
I see him in my dreams
We ride the enchanted crystal railroad
Frog lanterns in the night
Across the mountains and the seas
We're free

We are riding on enchanted crystal railroads
With the knowledge of all those who came before
Driven crazy by the power that's inside me
Now the time has come for us to win the war oh-oh

We fight for the frogs who came before us
The frogs will be our guide
The wizard shark now blocks the way
I see him in my dreams
We ride the enchanted crystal railroad
Frog lanterns in the night
Across the mountains and the seas
Its time to be set free once more
We fight for the frogs who came before us
The frogs will be our guide
The wizard shark was blown away
I watched that big shark die
We ride the enchanted crystal railroad
Frog lanterns in the night
Across the mountains and the seas
We're free
Yeah

Takie jak bym chciał
Tyle chcę powiedzieć
Lecz odwagi ciągle brak
Tyle spraw

Nie wiem czy mam siłę
Stawić czoła przeznaczeniu

Pogrąża mnie w uczucie
Niespełnienia!

Potrzebuję duchowego odrodzenia?
A może ja..

Potrzebuję cielesnego narodzenia?
Wolności poczuć smak!

To zmartwychwstanie! (z martwych)

Zakryte milczeniem

Frosttide - We Will be Gone

1 ContributorWe Will be Gone Lyrics
Behold this scene
All what we've done
All this in our hands for now
It's all so fragile
It can make you pray
Though, take you away
To prepare it all for?

For no one
(All your memories will vanish)
Everything will become undone
Done for none
(Like you were never even there)
And your life matters no more

And so to the skies you look
You wonder where you belong
Nothing is definite
But one day you will be gone

You spend your short life
Seeking, finding something you lust
The values are defined
And you gather all the stuff
Soon worth to dust

While to the skies you look
Oh, you've looked for so long
Still wondering who you are
And where you belong
One day you may realise
What you become

(Behold this scene
It's all so fragile
You make your memories for nothing but yourself
And in the end
All becomes undone
Behold this scene
The lucky existence of you and I
Set to end in nothing
Like we were never even there)

The delusion you're significant
Blurs you mind
Makes you blind
They didn't stand a chance in the hands of progress
How many sacrificed
For few more painful years
Really worth it?
I'm waiting
I'm asking
I'm waiting
For reason

So long, gone
(Lying on your deathbed as the light fades)
Still struggle for more
More for none
(Just one more minute)
For no reason
You plea for

So to the skies you look
Wondering where you belong
The life will evolve
Even when you are gone
Some beautiful day
We all will be gone

Frozen Crown - Steel And Gold


Like the stars to the Sun
Like silver wolves chase the hawk
Steel and gold
On the battlefield warriors bow to your crown

We stand as one, holding our ground through the flames
Never surrender
Daughters of Wind aiding with thunder and rain for the last time
Hordes coming forth
Hailing from north in the name of the pretender
To the throne we fight for, pledging our soul to the king

Ready to strike, no second chances
Our deadly blades will not fail
No change of mind, whether we live or die
Our kingdom is going to stand

Like the stars to the Sun
Like silver wolves chase the hawk
Steel and gold
On the battlefield warriors bow to your crown
Give us might to raise our swords again, our lord
Heart of stone
A thousand souls set to fall for your throne

Reach for the sun
Lust and ambition can burn, remember
Am I on the run or the one chasing the prey
You never know
Born in the grave, spending your life in the shade of his splendour
Your master, your king
Casting your life to the wind

Night after night, blade after blade
Here lies the secret of steel
There comes a time when jewels cease to shine
And your heart is all you've left

Like the stars to the Sun
Like silver wolves chase the hawk
Steel and gold
On the battlefield warriors bow to your crown
Give us might to raise our swords again, our lord
Heart of stone
A thousand souls set to fall for your throne


Like the stars to the Sun
Like silver wolves chase the hawk
Steel and gold
On the battlefield warriors bow to your crown
Give us might to raise our swords again, our lord
Heart of stone
A thousand souls set to fall for your throne

Jonathan Young - Wellerman

1 ContributorWellerman Lyrics
There once was a ship that put to sea
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys, blow

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
Onе day, when the tonguing is done
Wе'll take our leave and go

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
Hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

No line was cut, no whale was freed
The captain's mind was not on greed
He belonged to the Whaleman's creed
She took that ship in tow

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

For 40 days or even more
The line went slack then tight once more
The boats were lost, there were only 4
And still that whale did go

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his regular call
To encourage the captain, crew and all

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and
Take our leave and, take our leave and go

Lord of the Lost - Drag Me to Hell


(One)
You like to give me strength
To face the daily dirt
(Two)
You fill my hollow heart
With fake self worth
(Three)
You like to let me know
I cannot break the spell
(Four)
The more I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell

This love eviscerates
Still I am in your thrall
Sleep offers no escape
I feel temptation call
Repulsed by my own mind
Obsession craves respect
To justify the time
When all the pain can make sense to me
You can't be what you're not

(The more I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell)

Hate me forever and ever
The more that you love me
The more it will ever
Kill me, forever and ever
The more that life stabs me
The more and the more and the more
The more that I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell!

You keep the secret of
My sordid other life
You guarantee to take
My lows so high then I fall again
You can't beat what you are

(The more I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell)

Hate me forever and ever
The more that you love me
The more it will ever
Kill me, forever and ever
The more that life stabs me
The more and the more and the more
The more that I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell!

(One)
You've made me steal
You've made me lie
(Two)
You've made me weak
Wanting to die
(Three)
I'm not your first
Won't be your last
(Four)
All that I ask
Don't drag me to hell
Drag me to hell
It's war baby, war baby, war baby, yeah
It's war baby, war, life is war
Drag me to hell

Hate me forever and ever
The more that you love me
The more it will ever
Kill me, forever and ever
The more that life stabs me
The more and the more and the more
The more that I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to

Hate me
Kill me
The more that I reach out for heaven
The more you drag me to hell

Lutharo - Time to Rise


Come home now
Sleep, my child (Sleep, my child)
These overbearing wounds suffocated you enough
Lay to rest
These burdens in your chest
Your future is too prosperous to break like this
This armour that you wear
Was never yours to bear
These years have gotten heavier
This nightmare that you reap
Was never yours to keep
This anguish never yours

I promise this process, it takes time, I'll be your guide
I know you are not used to trusting in this blunt of timе
Keep your head up, you are doing just fine
Likе a phoenix you're reviving till your time to rise
Go on and take a bow
With damage you've allowed
How hasn't life struck you down?
Let's throw the towel in
Resign as the villain
Come on, let's shed some skin

There's more to what you see, unravel me
It's easy to stay quiet but they'll never silence me
These hills you've climbed will justify with time
Your role is growing tired and it's time for it to die


There's more to what you see, unravel me
It's easy to stay quiet but they'll never silence me
These hills you've climbed will justify with time

There's more to what you see, unravel me
It's easy to stay quiet but they'll never silence me
These hills you've climbed will justify with time
Your role is growing tired and it's time for it to die

Holding to your lifeless light
I hear you calling for me
Invoke my name with your sword
And your life, bestow me
I'll watch the demon rip your soul
All hail the God of war!
Ori ori give me glory
Ori ori sing my story
Ori ori give me glory
Love me hate me ori ori
You taste of fear before demise
For that I have no sorrow
Through the weakness in your eyes
I'll live again, tomorrow
I'll watch the demon rip your soul
All hail the God of war!
Ori ori give me glory
Ori ori sing my story
Ori ori give me glory
Love me hate me ori ori

Megaherz - 5. März

Siehst du mich
Hörst du mich
Was hab ich dir getan
Warum zerstörst du mich
Fühlst du mich
Spürst du mich
Wenn du mich nicht mehr liebst
Warum berührst du mich
Brauchst du mich
Sag glaubst du nicht
Dass es besser ist
Du lebst dein Leben ohne mich
Erkennst du mich
Verstehst du nicht
Warum bist du überhaupt noch hier
Was willst du noch von mir
Augen auf
Wer sieht versteht
Wie gnadenlos die Zeit vergeht
Wie sich der Zeiger dreht
Unentwegt
Er steht nie still
Du weißt nicht was du willst
Du weißt nicht wo du stehst
Weißt nicht woher du kommst
Wohin du gehst
Du weißt nicht was dich treibt
Was am Ende für dich bleibt
Warum bist du so blass
So kalt so herzlos
Du weißt nicht was du tust
Weißt nicht woran du glaubst
Sag mir wozu und ob
Du mich noch brauchst
Wenn's einfach nicht mehr passt
Wenn du mich wirklich nur noch hasst
Warum bist du noch hier
Wofür
Was willst du noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch von mir

Siehst du mich
Erkennst du mich
Ganz tief in meinem Herz ist noch ein Platz für dich
Ich suche dich
Ich sehne mich
Nach dem was ich geliebt hab
Doch ich find' es nicht
Augen auf
Wer sieht versteht
Wie gnadenlos die Zeit vergeht
Wie sich der Zeiger dreht
Unentwegt
Er steht nie still
Viel zu lange
Viel zu spät
Sturm geerntet
Wind gesät
Die Zeit vergeht
Unentwegt
Sie steht nie still
Du weißt nicht was du willst
Du weißt nicht wo du stehst
Weißt nicht woher du kommst
Wohin du gehst
Du weißt nicht was dich treibt
Was am Ende für dich bleibt
Warum bist du so blass
So kalt so herzlos
Du weißt nicht was du tust
Weißt nicht woran du glaubst
Sag mir wozu und ob
Du mich noch brauchst
Wenn's einfach nicht mehr passt
Wenn du mich wirklich nur noch hasst
Warum bist du noch hier
Wofür
Was willst du noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du wirklich noch von mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch von mir
Sag Mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch von mir
Sag Mir
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du noch
Was willst du wirklich noch von mir

Und grinsen dem Tod dreckig ins Gesicht

Der Tag kann unser letzter sein
Die Zeit bleibt niemals stehen, sie holt uns ein
Mittendrin statt nur daneben
In vollen Zügen genießen das Leben
Wir gehen drauf mit Pauken und Trompeten

Drei Sekunden, aber länger nicht
Jeder Gedanke verflüchtigt sich
Härter, kränker ohne Gegengift
Scheißegal, aber langweil mich nicht

Infiziert, viel zu viel von allem
Splitter, die mir in den Schädel knall'n
Das Virus streut, der Kollaps droht
Es ist geschafft, Patient tot

Epidemie, ich kann nicht mehr mit mir alleine sein
Epidemie, ich bin mir selbst der größte Feind
Epidemie, die ganze Welt hängt schief
Die Geister, die ich rief, der Alptraum endet nie
Epidemie, ich kann nicht mehr mit mir alleine sein

Nur Daumen hoch oder blanker Hass
Alles dazwischen macht mir keinen Spaß
Sprich mich nicht an, jedes Wort verschwimmt
Ich bin nie da, wo ich gerade bin

Twilight Guardians - La Isla Bonita

1 ContributorLa Isla Bonita Lyrics

Como puede ser verdad
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Sonata Arctica - White Pearl, Black Oceans...


I was born and raised by the sea, shy yet proud
Learned to stay away from the crowd
In my home, my lighthouse
101 steps, 'round and down
New Year's Eve, one night on the town
Can change one life into eternity


All I could see were her eyes
We got caught in the moment, all of the night
Taken beyond all lines, in silence, leaving 'em all behind
She had found the sails for the following night
The town, for her, was getting way too small
She promised to be mine
Forever, for that one night
Moments, passion, small defeats
Concealed emotions found in me
"You gave life to a brand new me"
Crossing the wintry fields
The first hour of morning light
Warmed by the flame inside
The lasting memory of the ending night
I never had a chance to stop what hit me
What broke my bones and mauled me
After hours of deep, unwilling sleep
In a cold shelter, fell back into the dark
(And the hours of the day passed)

A nightmare awakes me, blinking light
There's no guide, blind ships in the night
Oh, blood-red moon, eat away the night
Darkness covers my lonely soul
No one to feed the dying light


(Good morn—oh dreadful day)
I prayed the moon had lit the sea instead of me
For the sails of night
"Please tell me everything is alright"
(My voice in the room broke the silence)
Everybody killed me with their eyes
What I was to hear made the people cry
(Impossible for me to keep the tears inside)

All on board the White Pearl have died
Coastal reef has tolled their lives
And you are the light of the night

One thing I remember before I fell to the ground
Although I never saw the face
A name was inked on his arm
Love can be like poetry of demons
Or maybe God loves complex irony?
The family name stated I had seen before
Written on her front door
(Silence in the courthouse)
A presence in the room we both could feel
The father of her unborn child and me

All on board the White Pearl have died
Coastal reef has tolled their lives
While I was the guide light
Back in my tower, run, run, run
Light is out, I hope to see
Black oceans beneath, rise and swallow me



One step will take me back inside
Another sees my end
No one can love a man who guarded the light
(Guarded the light, one faithful night)
Flaming eyes I must confront before I am stated free
Defining innocence is hell, after all that has passed
Building new walls inside (My eternal night)
Although they took my heart and dried me up
Sometimes I still bleed
Show me the way
(Show me the way)
The light will show me a way on the grisly reefs
Too many dead ends I see
No soul can save me
The respect I lost, the measure of a man


10,000 steps down, 'round and round
One night on the town, and I'm hell-bound
Black oceans beneath, come and swallow me
All on board the White Pearl have died
Coastal reef, come claim my life
Black oceans beneath (Come and swallow me)
My little tower, seal my fate
Help me pay back, end their hate
Black oceans beneath (Come and swallow me)
One direction, down, down, down
Pitch-black night for my old town
Black oceans beneath shall now swallow me


I hereby commit the body to the deep
To be turned into corruption
Looking for the resurrection of the body
When the sea shall give up her dead
And the life of the world to come
Through our Lord
Amen

Phantom Elite - The Race

1 ContributorThe Race Lyrics
Destiny, tragically, was chosen for you
The call of your duty that's ringing like a
Symphony of agony, a nightmare come true
I shall wait, come back by my side

And as time passes by
Love turns into a pain I can barely survive
What a sad lullaby

Haunting my dreams like a ghost in the night
A nightmare so real or a vision divine
Solemnly dancing with me like a farewell
A serenade under the stars
Every night crushing my heart

The sun arises one more time on a new day
Torn apart by this love, your presence starts to
Fade away, but I will wait, and fight my way
In the light, as I long for the night

Haunting my dreams like a ghost in the night
A nightmare so real or a vision divine
Solemnly dancing with me like a farewell
A serenade under the stars
Every night crushing my heart

Blood for blood
The answer of it all
The tragedy blinding our kind
Our kind

And as life passes by
Time seems to fly away but the pain never dies
Oh my heart is on fire

Haunting my dreams like a ghost in the night
A nightmare so real or a vision divine
Solemnly dancing with me like a farewell
A serenade under the stars
Every night crushing my heart
Every night crushing my heart

Iskry sypią się spod kół
Bo tłumik gdzieś zahacza
Do abordażu czas
Gdy Tiry dwa ścigają się
Po prawej się przecisnę
Niech wszyscy wiedzą że

Pull The Wire - Papieros


Świat się chyba coraz szybciej kręci
Życie szybciej się toczy
Nie mam czasu podać tobie  ręki
Nie mam czasu spojrzeć w oczy
Każdy pędzi gdzieś, każdy w swoją stronę
Pieniądz wyznacza drogę
Nie mam siły już, wewnątrz cały płonę
Sensu znaleźć w tym nie mogę

I tak każdy skończy jak papieros
Wypalony, w piach wdeptany, zapomniany
I tak każdy skończy jak papieros
Wypalony, w piach wdeptany, zapomniany

Chciwy obłęd trawi ludzkie myśli
Kradnie reszki rozumu
W głowie chaos, nic już mi się nie śni
Oprócz pędzącego tłumu
Każdy pędzi gdzieś, każdy w swoją stronę
Z zamkniętymi oczami
Każdy skończy biec w swoim własnym grobie
Ze sztucznymi kwiatami

 x2
I tak każdy skończy jak papieros
Wypalony, w piach wdeptany, zapomniany
I tak każdy skończy jak papieros
Wypalony, w piach wdeptany, zapomniany
Szybciej biegniesz, szybciej zdechniesz

You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in, again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?

You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time our soul untold
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that will take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
What if I say I'm not like the others?

Und auf die Narben, denn so füll' ich sie auf, ja

Und weihe sie mit Gottes Macht

I'm sitting here alone in darkness, waiting to be free
Lonely and forlorn, I am crying
I long for my time to come, death means just life
Please let me die in solitude

Hate is my only friend, pain is my father
Torment is delight to me
Death is my sanctuary, I seek it with pleasure
Please let me die in solitude

Receive my sacrifice, my lifeblood is exhausted
No one gave love and understanding
Hear these words, vilifiers and pretenders
And please let me die in solitude

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust

Sitting here alone in darkness, waiting to be free
Lonely and forlorn, I am crying
I long for my time to come, death means just life
Please let me die in solitude, yeah

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust

And please let me die in solitude

Deals Death - Fortified

Silhouettes on the hills and plains are closing in as I try to escape
Enemies are looking to wipe me out
Hunted down for what I believe, for what I said now my fate seems sealed
They thought I'd never speak
But I am not a slave and I will never ever swallow their lies
Fortified!
A cover up, ancient secrets, well preserved
Shackling oppression
I hold the answers in my head
By any means they will stay in control, a utopia for the chosen elite
I never will conform
Cause I am not a slave I am a warrior and ready to die
To bring 'em down
Painted black by the guardians
My verdict has arrived
I follow my calling
The voice that beckons me
My legacy is rebellious chaos
A seed of hope is growing
As my final dusk ends in blood
By any means they will stay in control, a utopia for the chosen elite
I will not die in vain
The impact that I've made is everlasting for the ones who rebels
Fortified!

My legacy is rebellious chaos
That will never?
Painted black by the guardians
My verdict has arrived
I follow my calling
The voice that beckons me!

Moonspell - Alma Mater

Mother tongue speaks to me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in me
Her proudest child, her purest breed
She speaks to me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend
For I am your holy child
And you're my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the powers within
For I her your only child
And she's my dearest mystery
World, can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?
Virando costas ao mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória antiga, volta a nós
Alma mater
Breaking waves announce my dride
Is the only way the sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring
At the moon mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die

For I am her only child
And she's my dearest mystery
Pagan gods in conspiracy
For the sword of tyranny
Mother tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World, can't you see?
I'm not alone in my belief
Virando costas ao mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória antiga, volta a nós

Moonspell - Extinct


In each other's arms
At each other's throats
In the time out of mind
We buried our love
No moon to guide us tonight
No light to see us through

Let's pray for the waters to come
Let's pray
I pray time stops
While you rot
I pray time stops

Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct
Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct

Without control
The ark took sail
To the far beyond
Through the limits of time
No moon to guide us
Just the star of death
To lead our way

Let's pray for the waters to come
Let's pray
I pray time stops
While we rot
Let’s pray time stops

Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct
Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
Just one taste of your lips
Before we go extinct


Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct
Before the lights go out
Before our time is gone
A taste of your lips
Before we go extinct

Moonspell - Finisterra


The world has turned once more inside
Brought up a message from our dead:
The ones you love the most
Are the ones you hurt as deep
The world has turned once more inside
Anchored into captivity
The ones you wanted the most
The ones you buried under sea

Exit wounds, waterdrums
Dream the eternal return
Tree of life rotting inside
Autumn leaves, winter white

A light at the end of the earth
A light at the end of the earth

Whole world a ghost shading inside
True love waits for the bless of death
The doubt that sets me free
Not to remember anything

Stillborn, bloodlet
Die in our feet like the trees
Earthsong, neverland
Let the blood have its way

A light at the end of the earth
A light at the end of the earth

A lie at the end of the earth
A lie at the end of the earth

Was it for this we sold our souls?
Was it for this we missed our chance of leaving?

A lie at the end of the earth
A lie at the end of the earth

Heathen Foray - Bifrost

1 ContributorBifrost LyricsDie Zeit ist schon lang vorbei
Ich werd nie mehr zu Kampfe ziehn
Nie mehr meinen Mut beweisen
Mein Schwert nie mehr in Knochen beißen
Nie mehr wird ich in Feindesblut
Meinen Körper baden können
Doch wird man meinen Heldenmut
Noch in vielen Sagen nennen
Gedanken wir in alten Tagen
Als ich so manche Schlacht geschlagen
Doch diese Zeit ist schon lang vorbei
Ich lass los und werde frei!
Mein Ende naht, ich sink hinab
Auf den Grund voll Feindesblut
Ich drück mein Schwert an meine Seit'
Schließe die Augen ein letztes Mal
Durfte kämpfen
Durfte küssen
Durft' so manche Weisheit wissen
Durfte leben
Durfte lieben
Durft' so manchen Feind besiegen
Blick ich zurück auf alte Tage
Fühl ich Reue – keine Frage
Könnt ich es nochmal wagen
Würd ich noch mehr Feind erschlagen!

Viele Wege durft ich gehn
Viele Orte durft ich sehn
Das Alter hat mich eingeholt
Die Zeit verlangt nach ihr'm Tribut
Gedanken wir in alten Tagen
Als ich so manche Schlacht geschlagen
Doch diese Zeit ist schon lang vorbei
Ich lass los und werde frei!
Gleißender Sonnenschein durchbricht die Nacht
Ein Regenbogen tut sich vor mir auf
Auf ihr herab Rasen Weiber auf Rossen
Mächtig, stark und schön!
Walküren haben mich
Ausgewählt um aufzusteigen!
Über Bifrosts lange Bahne
Soll die Reise führen!
Walküren, küsst mich wach
Hebt mich hoch zu eurer Mitte
Hebt mich hoch zu Odins Tafel
Werd fürstlich speisen gehen!
Vorbei an Heimdalls Wacht
Vorbei am großen roten Feuer
Vorbei an allem was einmal gewesen war!

Ich werd bis Ragnarök
Mich jeden Abend nur mehr schlagen
All meinen Hass grimmig gegen Riesen richten
Durfte kämpfen
Durfte küssen
Durft' so manche Weisheit wissen
Durfte leben
Durfte lieben
Durft' so manchen Feind besiegen
Blick ich zurück auf alte Tage
Fühl ich Reue – keine Frage
Könnt ich es nochmal wagen
Würd ich noch mehr Feind erschlagen!
Durfte kämpfen
Durfte küssen
Durft' so manche Weisheit wissen
Durfte leben
Durfte lieben
Durft' so manchen Feind besiegen
Blick ich zurück auf alte Tage
Fühl ich Reue – keine Frage
Könnt ich es nochmal wagen
Würd ich noch mehr Feind erschlagen!!

Nightrage - Euphoria Within Chaos


This feeling of dark sorrow comes to beckon me
It points out all that I’ve become
A Losing battle is not the end of (the) war
Another chance to victimize these words
Eternally
We always knew
That sacrifice invented pain and life
Behind the veil
A wall of mist
Become the shadows of our past

We’ve come to take you away
Before this grief appears
Enter the shelter of fate
Revive the embers of the past

Surrounded by the night meander like a flood
Out of this dream I crawl into this dead world
A Fast trigger to end these horrible thoughts
Terrorizing my existence to the bone
Eternally
We always knew
That sacrifice invented pain and life
Behind the veil
A wall of mist
Become the shadows of our past

We’ve come to take you away
Before this grief appears
Enter the shelter of fate
Revive the embers of the past

Revive the embers of the past
Take me away
Clean

This lonesome heartfelt emotion

With pride I leave behind
This filthy world of shadows and lies
With pride I leave behind
This filthy world of shadows and lies
Eternally
We always knew
That sacrifice invented pain and life
Behind the veil
A wall of mist
Become the shadows of our past

We’ve come to take you away
Before this grief appears
Enter the shelter of fate
Revive the embers of the past
Before this grief appears
Revive the embers of the past

Nightrage - The Venomous


Our destiny to stand apart
Firmly written in stone from the start
A demonic wish we could never resist
Deeply rooted inside of our hearts
Black angel wings and a vipers tail
Still a smile that we could not resist
A deeper sense of sanity
Since the first day ceased to exist

We are the only cure
To the poison we spit
Time to wipe away
All that we became

Breed the Venomous
We thrive, under the spell of Marchosias
Our goddess of conflict and war

Our journey on the face of this earth
Has now forever left its mark
An endless search for more
Drove us straight into the dark

We are the only cure
To the poison we spit
Time to wipe away
All that we became

Breed the Venomous
We thrive, under the spell of Marchosias
Our goddess of conflict and war

Breed the Venomous
We thrive, under the spell of Marchosias
Our goddess of conflict and war

All hail the Venomous
We dance to the beat of the glorious
Hear our gospel of conflict and war

Nightrage - Affliction


As our lives are forged in battle
We're in search for an answer
All innocence since long we lost
Now! As we're dragged along the undertow

Reflections
Of all our past mistakes
Domination
The glory of our prime

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn?
Reflecting an empty past
Blackening inside of my affliction
As we sow now we shall reap

On our path we march as cattle
In search for a meaning
Our destination in clouds concealed
Still claiming to be in control

Reflections
Of all our past mistakes
Domination
The glory of our prime

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn?
Reflecting an empty past
Blackening inside of my affliction
As we sow now we shall reap

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn?
Blackening inside of my affliction

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn?
Reflecting an empty past
Blackening inside of my affliction
As we sow now we shall reap

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn?
Blackening inside of my affliction

Atavistia - Ethereal Wanderer

1 ContributorEthereal Wanderer LyricsWithin the dark plains of time
Twisting shadows of dying light
Frozen clouds embrace the mind
Follow the calling void
Crying out to take a breath
Falling ashes douse the soul
Embers soaring through the smoke
All star filled skies die
In astral flame
In warping time
And waning light
Tear out the life, the love, the hope
Fall back into the boundless sea
Before divine reality
Uncover true misanthropy
Oh
Lost in the ether's maze
Nurtured by transcending phase
Cast away your mortal form
In death, become reborn
Forgotten are the old ways
Forbidden from the warm days
Guided by the ghost
Bound forever in endless space

Ethereal wanderer
Eternal universe
Ethereal wanderer
Eternal mystery
In the dark
Tear of time
Within old stars
I fade away
Far beyond oceans teeming with life
From the deepest caverns of long, cold, and distant worlds
Roaming endlessly through time and space
Forever adrift upon this place
Fly
Fly to feel alive
Nowhere to hide
Faster than light
I must decide
Where my memories go
Till ancient wisdom grows in my soul
Show me my desire
Hold me now
Oh, give me your power
To rule time

Right the wrongs of my life
On newly formed paths unknown
From the shadows of the past I rise
Welcoming the night
Call upon the broken dream
Where light shines around a crown
This is what I seek
A chance to be free
On the edge of tomorrow
Behind fading sorrow
Show me the path ahead
Dawning horizon
Darkness forgotten
Grant me the power of the dead
The sun, the moon, everlasting memory
Fade away in my mind
A future so still
Guiding light
Follow the one who wanders in nightfall
Between realms of broken lifetimes
Blinded in confusion
By the dark illusion
Promised with a broken fate
Told a tale of lies
By immortal eyes
Flowing from the voice of the Ethereal Wanderer

Nita Strauss - The Wolf You Feed


The dark, the night
Only linger when you won't open your eyes
To seek and find
A world whose bark outweighs its
Bite the hand
Life's a battle you command
A great divide
Dictates the howling of the mind

Though the moon outruns the sun
She reflects her light

Tell me everything you need to kill the numb
And find the strength to become
A storm that never loses speed, when it's said and done
You become the wolf you feed

The wolf you feed

Two halvеs, unwhole
Twisting stories to be told
Tightropеs we tread
Bridge heaven and hell inside our
Heads held high
Contemplating fight or flight
You ask me why
I say the answer lies inside

Though the moon outruns the sun
She reflects her light

Tell me everything you need to kill the numb
And find the strength to become
A storm that never loses speed, when it's said and done
You become the wolf you feed


Oh, tell me everything you need to kill the numb  (Tell me everything you need)
And find the strength to become (Strength to become)
A wolf that never needs to feed, it's said and done
You've become the wolf you need

The wolf you need

One of the most recognizable guitar riffs in rock'n'roll history. “Smoke on the Water” tells the true story of a fire igniting during a 1971 Frank Zappa concert in Montreux, Switzerland, where the band had… Read More 

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

There's a place where everyone can be happy
It's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world
It's made of candy canes and planes and bright red choo choo trains
And the meanest little boys, the most innocent little girls
And, you know, I wish that I could go there
It's a road that I have not found
And I wish you the best of luck, dear
Just drop a card or letter to my side of town

'Cause there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend
But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send

And you painted my entire world
But I don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
And I won't forget it

There's a place where everyone can be right
Even though you remain determined to be opposed
Admittance requires no qualifications
It's where everyone has been, and where everybody goes
So please try not to be impatient
For we all hate standing in line
And when the farm is good and bought, you'll be there without a thought
And eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time

As there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send

And you painted my entire world
But I don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
And I won't forget it

Black Veil Brides - In The End


In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life?

In the end
As my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell? (A shell, a shell)
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory
(I gave it all)

In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life? (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye? (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

(I'm not afraid)
(I'm not afraid to die)

Born a saint
Though with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall, I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life? (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye? (oh whoa oh oh)

I'm not afraid to die

There is a price to be freed
Break these chains and fly away
One leader is all it takes
To destroy the world

Die Apokalyptischen Reiter - Der Adler

Ich zog aus, um zu verstehen
Wollte fühlen, was and're sehen
Seelenhunger trieb mich an
Und sprengte tausendfach meinen Verstand
Als ich den Berg erklommen
Die See dem Sturm den Schnee genommen
Traf mich ungestüm ein Blick
Gebannt riss er mich mit
Und ich sah in seine wilden Augen
Er lud mich ein, mit ihm zu geh'n
Auf seinen Schwingen fühlt' ich alles Leben
Die Zeit wich dem Moment wie alles Fleh'n
Er durchwandert die Zeiten
Nun schon seit Ewigkeiten
Er, der nicht süchtig wandelt
Der des Lebens nur gewahr
Nicht Besitz noch Mammons Fesseln
Keinem Führer keinem Helden
Nur sich selbst den Fron gegeben
Erhebt er sich in freie Welten
Und ich sah in seine wilden Augen
Er lud mich ein, mit ihm zu geh'n
Auf seinen Schwingen fühlt' ich alles Leben
Die Zeit wich dem Moment wie alles Fleh'n

Nicht in Hast verloren
Wird er endlos neu geboren
Jeder Augenblick ein Freund
Ich hatte davon geträumt
Die Gunst, zu erleben
Nach nichts zu streben
Machte mich erneut zum Kinde
Wiegte stürmisch meine Sinne
Und ich sah in seine wilden Augen
Er lud mich ein, mit ihm zu geh'n
Auf seinen Schwingen fühlt' ich alles Leben
Die Zeit wich dem Moment wie alles Fleh'n

Do It With Malice - That Guy

1 ContributorThat Guy LyricsClose your eyes and you’re blinded by the light
Lift them up and you’re terrorized by the night
Left in the dark and the lyrics tend to bleed
Inside my mind the black makes it harder to see
You always say what you want when you want to say it
You never do what I tell you to anyway
You never think to yourself that a time will come
When the beginning is close but the end is far from done
See for yourself, the sky’s on fire
The turmoil and chaos is all adding up to be
What you once feared about the ones dear to you
To your heart, to the parts you worry about
It’s hard to reach for the better things in life
Find the reason, the motive not to fight
Fill the shallow six feet in front of me
Break the stone and rise up to be, rise up to be
The hero, the man to know (man to know)
The one you come to and the one and only place to go
The hero, every time you come around
The reprimand is fading to become the outcast, never found
Like the unprotected adolescence forgotten with years
Or the pessimistic prodigy that deafened ears won’t hear
Bringing thoughts from the other side, wiping tears you try to hide
Lifted hopes get crushed liked the feelings that will never die
You think you know but you’re blinded by greed
You think you’ve won but you’re never gonna see the green
Unless you live, unless you love, unless you try to help and rise above
The feeling that has overcome and left the crowd to all become nothing

See for yourself, the sky’s on fire
The turmoil and chaos is all adding up to be
What you once feared about the ones dear to you
To your heart, to the parts you worry about
It’s hard to reach for the better things in life
Find the reason, the motive not to fight
Fill the shallow six feet in front of me
Break the stone and rise up to be, rise up to be
The hero, the man to know (man to know)
The one you come to and the one and only place to go
The hero, every time you turn around
The reprimand is fading to become the outcast, never found
So I stick out my hands to those who weep
I pick those up who find it hard to see
Things have changed, it’ll never be the same
And the ones who can help are the ones who’ve been playing the game
Flashes ignite as truth becomes clear
As you unmask it all becomes clear
Flashes of light as the dusk turns into night
‘Cause the ones who you trust are the ones you’ve been trying to fight
So I stick out my hands to those who weep
I pick those up who find it hard to see
Things have changed, it’ll never be the same
And the ones who can help are the ones who’ve been playing the game

Flashes ignite as truth becomes clear
As you unmask it all becomes clear
Flashes of light as the dusk turns into night
‘Cause the ones who you trust are the ones you’ve been trying to fight
The hero, the man to know (man to know)
The one you come to and the one and only place to go
The hero, every time you come around
The reprimand is fading to become the outcast, never found
The hero, the man to know
The one you come to and the one and only place to go
The hero, every time you come around
The reprimand is fading to become the outcast, never found

Do It With Malice - Symphonic Homicide

1 ContributorSymphonic Homicide LyricsI know you want it to be painless quick and easy
Don’t turn your back our horns are about to attack
Well, there is no better way to- better way to make you
Break down to your knees and beg not to bleed
You can run, you can hide just to get away
You can scream so loud but it’s sad to say
You’re gonna cry, you’re gonna die tonight
You’re gonna wish you lived a better life
Know you want it oh so bad
Just plug your ears and wish you had
Your weapon that forty-five
Now pull that trigger and say goodnight
Pierce your eardrums if you dare
To tell the truth, I just don’t care
Pack your bags and say so long
I'll kill you with this song
Symphonic Homicide
I know you want it to be a crazy dream where you wake up sweating
From the higher brass about to kick your ass
There is no better way to- better way to hate you
Stupid ass punk boys not makin’ talent just makin’ noise

You can run, you can hide just to get away
You can scream so loud but it’s sad to say
You’re gonna cry, you’re gonna die tonight
You’re gonna wish you lived a better life
We band together like a crazy mob
With a horn in one hand and the checkerboards on
So put your hands together tonight
As the rudeboys unite
Pierce your eardrums if you dare
To tell the truth, I just don’t care
Pack your bags and say so long
I'll kill you with this song
Pierce your eardrums if you dare
To tell the truth, I just don’t care
Pack your bags and say so long
I'll kill you with this song

Stiko Per Larsson - Antarctica

1 ContributorAntarctica LyricsGenom tunnlar kan du följa min spår
Jag blandar isen med min sista frusna tår
Och jag kräver er landet som mitt
För min sorgs seger och allt blod jag spillt
Genom tystnaden kan du ana ett vrål
Det kom från själen som jag längesen lagt ifrån
Jag vet mina planer var för två
Här i glömskan finns bara en plats att få
Och ser du mig då, jag lät
Tårar och is få bli min borg
En ny Poseidon, jag står där som statyn
På världens golv, världens golv
Mina lungor undrar varför dom är på
För en frusen luft gör andningen så svår
Och jag svär åt envishetens plikt
Och att min kropp aldrig ska hitta nånting tryggt
Mina fingrar har inte glömt var dom ska bo
Trots att handen är en klumpig iskall klo
Och jag kräver mitt liv ska bli en dikt
Om hur en man kan brinna utan några trick
Och ser du mig då, jag lät
Tårar och is få bli min borg
En ny Poseidon, jag står där som statyn
På världens golv, världens golv

Och ser du mig då, jag lät
Tårar och is få bli min borg
En ny Poseidon, jag står där som statyn
På världens golv
Och ser du mig då, jag lät
Tårar och is få bli min borg
En ny Poseidon, jag står där som statyn
På världens golv, världens golv

Platinum Moon - Blacked Out (Hypocrite)


I never gave him what he deserved
Too late for compromise
To mend his with words
It took too long for me to understand
I couldn't change for him
But I'll change for my next man

Cause my heart wants a bed, rent free, stuck in his head
But my mouth can't resist burning one more bridge
And I know that he knows, that I lie through my teeth
It's not fair it's not fair, I hurt him, I broke me

When I blacked out again, I told my best friend
He wasn't the one, I'm such a damn hypocrite
Because I still had feelings that I just could not admit
It's hard to make amends when you're a hypocritе

I pretend I'm good at moving on
Smiles arе my best friends cause they fool everyone
And I can tell the girls I'm quite alright
But that won't take him out of my dream last night

Cause my heart wants a bed, rent free, stuck in his head
But my mouth can't resist burning one more bridge
And I know that he knows, that I lie through my teeth
It's not fair it's not fair, I hurt him, I broke me

When I blacked out again, I told my best friend
He wasn't the one, I'm such a damn hypocrite
Because I still had feelings that I just could not admit
It's hard to make amends when you're a hypocrite

I never gave him what he deserved
Too late for compromise
To mend his with words
It took too long for me to understand
I couldn't change for him
But I'll change for my next man

Cause my heart wants a bed, rent free, stuck in his head
But my mouth can't resist burning one more bridge
And I know that he knows, that I lie through my teeth
It's not fair it's not fair, I hurt him, I broke me


Well I blacked out again
I told my best friend
He wasn’t the one
I’m such a damn hypocrite
Cause I still had feelings
I just could not admit
It’s hard to make amends
When you’re a hypocrite

'cause I blacked out again
'cause I'm a hypocrite
I don't want it, I don't want it, yeah, yeah
'cause I blacked out again

Scary Kids Scaring Kids - The Dark


Did you hear that?
I'm awake

No way I'm going back to sleep right now
Did you see that? Feel the shake
They're comin' up from the underground, oh-oh
Taking cover in the thunderclouds
See it coming far away
In moments they'll invade the town
Hear the whispers turn to screams
Something's not right, get away right now, oh-oh
Grab what you can and let's get out

When the world falls apart
You feel the blood running from your heart
Sometimes it hurts to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
When you're feeling so lost in the dark
You feel the blood running from your heart
You should be proud to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
Piercing your light through the dark

Kick the door in, board it up
We're far away now, I think we're safe
Seal the windows, cut the lights
Don't let anything inside this place, oh-oh
Nobody's gonna come or go
I lay myself down to lick my wounds
I'm pacin' circles inside this room
I don't think this is the way
I need to end this face to face

When the world falls apart
You feel the blood running from your heart
Sometimes it hurts to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
When you're feeling so lost in the dark
You feel the blood running from your heart
You should be proud to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
Piercing your light through the dark
(Piercing your light through the dark)

Take the first step
Take the first step
Take the first step
Now

When the world falls apart
You feel the blood running from your heart
Sometimes it hurts to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
When you're feeling so lost in the dark
You feel the blood running from your heart
You should be proud to tally up your scars
It's time to show who you are
Piercing your light through the dark

Onlap - Everywhere I Go


I finally know why I can't get an answer
I finally know why I feel like a number
They keep a secret into their minds
They never talk even for telling lies

Make me feel (hey) at least like a monster
Make me feel (hey) at least like fire
It seems I can't find a place to go
There's a wall of things I'll never know
(Why would I escape?)

'Cause everywhere I go (ho)
There's nowhere I belong (ho)
Can anyone just tell me where will I find
'Cause everywhere I go (ho)
I'm always on my own (ho)
Can anyone just catch me before I drown
Can anybody make me feel like I'm not a stranger tonight

I finally know why I can't look further
I finally know why they don't speak louder
There is a secret that won't be mine
They'll never talk until the end of time

Make me feel (hey) at least like a monster
Make me feel (hey) at least like fire
It seems I can't find a place to go
There's a wall of things I'll never know

'Cause everywhere I go (ho)

Can anybody make me feel like I'm not a stranger tonight

(Hey, hey) What should I run away
(Hey, hey) I always felt this way
(Hey, hey) I cannot run away
(Hey, hey) I'm not a stranger tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
(Why would I escape?)

Everywhere I go (ho)
There's nowhere I belong (ho)
Can anyone just tell me where will I find
'Cause everywhere I go (ho)

BRDigung - Die Hände hoch



Es gibt Menschen, die sind arm und glücklich, andere nicht, sind Millionär
Andere rennen wie ein Esel dem lieben Geld hinterher
Arrogant und egoistisch, doch es ist alles Schein und Rauch
Er denkt, er ist was Besseres und seine falschen Freunde auch

Und wenn ihr denkt, bei diesen Menschen seid ihr fremd
Dann seid ihr bei uns genau richtig und jetzt macht...

Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr zufrieden seid mit dem, was ihr habt
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr glücklich seid mit dem, was ihr macht
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr nicht neidisch seid auf jede kleine Kleinigkeit
Wenn ihr zufrieden mit euch seid, dann macht die Hände hoch

Es gibt Menschen, die wollen dich besitzen, denn sie haben zu viel Angst
Angst davor allein zu sein, also sperren sie andere ein
Wieder andere definieren sich über Kleidung, über Geld
Ein Leben wie ein Kartenhaus, dass irgendwann zusammen fällt

Und wenn ihr denkt, bei diesen Menschen seid ihr fremd
Dann seid ihr bei uns genau richtig und jetzt macht...

Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr zufrieden seid mit dem, was ihr habt
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr glücklich seid mit dem, was ihr macht
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr nicht neidisch seid auf jede kleine Kleinigkeit
Wenn ihr zufrieden mit euch seid, dann macht die Hände hoch

Und wenn ihr denkt, bei diesen Menschen seid ihr fremd
Dann lasst sie liegen, auf das niemand sie mehr kennt
Ja, wenn ihr denkt, bei diesen Menschen seid ihr fremd
Die blöden Wichser, die man auch Narzissten nennt

Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr zufrieden seid mit dem, was ihr habt
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr glücklich seid mit dem, was ihr macht
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr nicht neidisch seid auf jede kleine Kleinigkeit
Wenn ihr zufrieden mit euch seid, dann macht die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr dankbar seid für das, was ihr macht
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr stolz drauf seid auf das, was ihr macht
Die Hände hoch
Wenn ihr nicht peinlich seid, dank dieser Oberflächlichkeit
Wenn ihr zufrieden mit euch seid, dann macht die Hände hoch

Borknagar - Nordic Anthem

There comes a time when all gods must fall
A time to answer our nation's call
No chains can bind us, shackles can't hold
The Northern spirit cannot be sold
This is our home
Our life is free
From coast to mountain
We will never bend our knee
We bow our heads to nothing but our past
Our breath is cold, we know our history will last
We won't bend our necks to any god
We won't bend our necks to any god
The north wind whispers in our ears
Old tales of hardship, of hopes and fears
We fought to forge our own destiny
Now we stand strong for the world to see
We won't bend our necks to any god
We won't bend our necks to any god
This is the north where spirits run free
From coast to mountain, that is our key
So, raise your head as our anthem rings
This is the north, so our people sings

Fejd - Den Skimrande

Nu dansar dimmor på tjärnen, som solen väckte
Då glimmar daggen i ljungen som natter skänkt i silver tår
En storloms klagan om döden, var hälsad frände
Var gång hon vaknar i jorden, och återföds
Se hon svävar fram, med diserna i dimman
Så skimrande och kall!
Den dagen bringan sitt offer, till ljusa väsen
Om hennes skuldror så vita, en mantel för de hängdas gud
Se blommor grönska vid graven, de åren varsla
Dess lycka äro förgången, i dyster skrud
Se hon svävar fram, med diserna i dimman
Så skimrande och kall!
Härlig var dansen frejdig och vild
Furorna flammar, solen går ned
Blickarna tindrar med ögon så blå
All jämt de vandra i en ring utav renaste guld
Hon vakar med sin sång
Försvinner bort i dimman
Hon vakar med sin sång
Försvinner bort i dimmorna

Se hon svävar fram, med diserna i dimman
Så skimrande och kall!

Mr. Hurley & Die Pulveraffen - Blau wie das Meer

Schon als Schiffsjunge hab ich meine Seele verkauft
An ne grosse Buddel Rum mit 3 x-en darauf
Ich will nur kurz dran nippen da passiert mir ein Malheur
Der Korken fällt mir über Bord die Flasche muss leer
Ich bin blau wie das Meer voll wie unser Laderaum
Breit so wie die Ärsche von den Weibern auf Tortuga
Ich bin blau wie das Meer geladen wie ein Bordgeschütz
Und dichter als der Nebel vor Kap Horn
Der Schiffsarzt sagt mir jeden Tag ich tränke zu viel Rum
Er bangt um meine Leber appelliert an die Vernunft
Doch wär für uns das Wasser zum trinken gedacht
Hätte Gott den Ozean nicht salzig gemacht
Ich bin blau wie das Meer voll wie unser Laderaum
Breit so wie die Ärsche von den Weibern auf Tortuga
Ich bin blau wie das Meer geladen wie ein Bordgeschütz
Und dichter als der Nebel vor Kap Horn
Gestern Abend hab ich wohl einen zu viel gehabt
Ich wache auf und hab in meiner Koje wenig Platz
Ich drehe mich nach Steuerbord und was muss ich da sehen
In meinem Bett liegt nackt die Frau vom Kapitän
Sie war blau wie das Meer voll wie unser Laderaum
Breit so wie die Ärsche von den Weibern auf Tortuga
Sie war blau wie das Meer geladen wie ein Bordgeschütz
Und dichter als der Nebel vor Kap Horn

Und kann ich mich morgens noch daran erinnern wo ich eingeschlafen bin
Muss das Gelage wohl trostlos gewesen sein
Wir liegen viel länger im Seemannsgrab als dass wir lebendig sind
Also gießt den drei Matrosen noch einen ein
Ich bin blau wie das Meer voll wie unser Laderaum
Breit so wie die Ärsche von den Weibern auf Tortuga
Ich bin blau wie das Meer geladen wie ein Bordgeschütz
Und dichter als der Nebel vor Kap Horn
Wir sind blau wie das Meer voll wie unser Laderaum
Breit so wie die Ärsche von den Weibern auf Tortuga
Wir sind blau wie das Meer geladen wie ein Bordgeschütz
Und dichter als der Nebel vor Kap Horn

Ye Banished Privateers - Rowing With One Hand

Rowing with one hand hey ho
Round and round and round I go
Lassies mourn and seamen flow
Rowing with one hand hey ho
Six weeks dry without consent
They all said no so off I went
Left the ship and aimed at shore
A sturdy grip around the oar
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Rowing in a rowing boat
A trail behind me left afloat
I’ll raise the level of the sea
Enjoying my own company
One oar on the deck I stow
Frees next hand to go below
I ain't going straight to port
Of fantasies I'm never short

Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Some like rowing two and two
Or pass the ore along the crew
Others row in solitude
All dressed up or in the nude
Some go left, and some go right
In circles rowing day and night
Takes a while to get us there
But timewise we are millionaires
My starboard arm as strong and grand
As nimble be my pistol hand
Greasy oil from sperm whale spleen
Keeps my leather nice and lean
Rowing with one hand hey ho
Round and round and round I go
Lassies mourn and seamen flow
Rowing with one hand hey ho

Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row

Blind Guardian - Violent Shadows


Don't turn away
Don't close your eyes
In false pride
Will you protect the light?
Reflect or shine?
That's your choice
We're heading straight into damnation
For an unknown god
It needs a rebel heart
It needs a pure soul
We're the condemned

I will not surrender, let it be
I will not surrender

Now bring me your sacraments
The dead will not complain about it
Try, it makes no difference
No difference
The bridgeman, hе must obey the order
Turns straight into thе raging storm
Hatred's never ending

Save us, set us free
Sky dancer
Down where the violent shadows breed
Hide in the underworld
Sky dancer
Hide where the violent shadows creep

Drown your pride
Young slave
Obey your master (Master, master, master)
It's all I can teach
Obey your master, master

Don't tell me you're innocent
Your guilt, there is no doubt about it
Crime, there's no deliverance
Deliverance
Watch out and believe it
Your men, they will be slaughtered
Give up, you better believe it, your mission's to

Take us, set it free
Sky dancer
Down where the violent shadows breed
Hide in the underworld
Sky dancer
Hide where the violent shadows creep

No need for a settlement
Your claim, there's proof, I truly doubt it
Crime deserves a punishment
Your punishment
The bridgeman can always cross the border
Your choice to make, it's one more step
Hear the chasm's calling

Take us, set it free
Sky dancer
Down where the violent shadows breed
Hide in the underworld
Sky dancer
Hide where the violent shadows creep

In violent shadows, we're all condemned
In violent shadows, we're all condemned
In violent shadows, we're all condemned
In violent shadows

Grave Digger - Killing Is My Pleasure (The Iceman)

1 ContributorKilling Is My Pleasure (The Iceman) LyricsAs shadows fall
There's a smile on my face
Unleashing the fury
In this unholy place
Raging fire
Burns deep inside my soul
The realm of death
I'm out of control
I feel hate on my own
You will never die alone
Killing is my pleasure
In the dead of night
Holding you close
Is my sweetest delight
Killing is my pleasure
And music to my ears
Screams of despair
Remain without fears
Echoes of pain
Resonate through the air
I am the iceman
With a merciless stare
Savage delight
In еvery life I take
For thе thrill of the hunt
I will never break

In Extremo - Herr Mannelig

Bittida en morgon innan solen upprann
Innan foglarna började sjunga
Bergatroliet friade till fager ungersven
Hon hade en falskeliger tunga
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej
Eder vill jag gifva de gångare tolf
Som gå uti rosendelunde
Aldrig har det varit någon sadel uppå dem
Ej heller betsel uti munnen
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej
Sådana gåfvor toge jag väl emot
Om du vore en kristelig qvinna
Men nu så är du det värsta bergatroll
Af Neckens och djävulens stämma
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej

Bergatrollet ut på dörren sprang
Hon rister och jämrar sig svåra
Hade jag fått den fager ungersven
Så hade jag mistat min plåga
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej
Herr Mannelig herr Mannelig trolofven i mig
För det jag bjuder så gerna
I kunnen väl svara endast ja eller nej
Om i viljen eller ej

In Extremo - Troja


Wir wollen durch das Leben pflügen
Durch Trojas Tore gehn
Gerissen lügen und Betrügen
Und lachend auf Euch nieder sehn

Drum steigen wir in dieses Pferd
Es sei Euch ein Geschenk
Wir reiten bis an euren Herd mit
Mit giftigem Getränk

Wir sind bald überall
Und das beste Pferd im Stall

Komm steig mit ein, wir sind das Gift im Wein
Unser Wille hart wie Stein - Treten Euch die Türen ein
Komm steig mit auf - Schläge nehm wir in Kauf
Mit uns geht die Sonne auf - Rolln die Stadt von innen auf
Bis Troja brennt!

Nie zu sehen nie zu hören
Liegt ein Feuerzeug im Stroh
Wartet dort auf dumme Gören
Sind nur in heißen Flammen froh

Drum hoch die Kelche seid bereit
Trinkt nur aus ihr werdet sehn
Und wenn ihr schön besoffen seid
Werden wir Euch den Hals umdrehen

Wir sind bald überall
Und das beste Pferd im Stall

Komm steig mit ein, wir sind das Gift im Wein
Unser Wille hart wie Stein - Treten Euch die Türen ein
Komm steig mit auf - Schläge nehm wir in Kauf
Mit uns geht die Sonne auf - Rolln die Stadt von innen auf
Bis Troja brennt!

Komm steig mit ein, wir sind das Gift im Wein
Unser Wille hart wie Stein - Treten Euch die Türen ein
Komm steig mit auf - Schläge nehm wir in Kauf
Mit uns geht die Sonne auf - Rolln die Stadt von innen auf
Bis Troja brennt!

Týr - Dragons Never Die

Long ago and far away a lindwyrm lay upon his hoard
No spear or sword could scratch a scale
Some gilded tale drew lads and lords
Enticed towards enormous hoards high on gold

And I, too, would want to try
The lindwyrm I will defy
But one look into his eye
I knew dragons never die
Whoever said, 'And they lived happily forever after,' lied
For tale and time go on no matter if I fail or find the
Unimaginable hoard high on gold

And I, too, would want to try
The lindwyrm I will defy
But one look into his eye
I knew dragons never die

I knew dragons never die
The lindwyrm I will defy
But one look into his eye
I knew dragons never die

My own shadow soul will fly
I take to the stormy sky
Dragons never die

Brothers of the mine rejoice!
Swing, swing, swing with me!
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
Sing, sing, sing with me!
Down and down into the deep
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold, and more
Hidden in the mountain store

Born underground
Suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark
The safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron
Steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on, brothers, sing with me!

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

The sunlight will not reach this low
Deep, deep in the mine
Never seen the blue moon glow
Dwarves won't fly so high
Fill a glass and down some mead
Stuff your bellies at the feast!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our mountain keep

Born underground
Grown inside a rocky womb
The Earth is our cradle
The mountain shall become our tomb
Face us on the battlefield
You will meet your doom
We do not fear what lies beneath
We can never dig too deep

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole


Born underground
Suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark
The safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron
Steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on, brothers, sing with me!

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

Elvenking - Luna


Sparked from celestial skies
Ethel forever (Luna)
A white flame glistened by moonshine
Heart-whole, pure as snow
Deceive she would never
Half a step beyond the flock she rode
With arms full open wide
We took her in, welcomed home without thinking
She'd light our sky

Luna, be my guide
In the burrows of this life
Oh, sister teach me how to thrive
In this place dark and unfair

Emerged from wood labyrinths
Ethel our treasure (Luna)
Starved and filthy, still a fairy light
Unknown where she came from
Ethereal, Moonclad maiden
Of purest love forged

Luna, be my guide
In the burrows of this life
Oh, sister teach me how to thrive
In this place dark and unfair
In a mighty flash of light
Like Mother Nature's bride
You appeared into my life
Don't ever leave me lone, oh, swear

Luna, be my guide
In the burrows of this life
Oh, sister teach me how to thrive

In a mighty flash of light

Heidevolk - A Wolf in My Heart

1 ContributorA Wolf in My Heart LyricsA new bound soul in human skin
That struggles to survive
But learn to trust the wolf within
And fight to stay alive
In the shadows, born in the night
Hunted by my foes, I fight the might
There's a wolf
In my heart
And it's fighting to survive
I've learnt to live
In the dark
For I was born with a wolf in my heart
A wolf in my heart
Stalking my prey
In the dead of night
I hold my breath
As I prepare to strike
My blood runs on this silent hill
A violent crime
As I'm moving for the kill
Because I've learnt to hunt
I've learnt to strike
And I kill
To survive

There's a wolf
In my heart
And it's fighting to survive
I've learnt to live
In the dark
For I was born
I gathered my pack at the brink of day
My brothers and sisters
They are there straight away
Hundreds of faces that fight for their kin
The vengeance and new dawn
For the wolf, within
A tribal and primal
For we will not be taken
Nor we will linger in the dark
Now here I
Roar!
Warriors dead on, hear my call
Swing your fist and make them go
Vengeance will be harsh today
An Eastern wolf that makes them
Yield!

There's a wolf
In my heart
And it's fighting to survive
I've learnt to live
In the dark
For I was born with a wolf in my heart
And it's fighting to survive
I've learnt to live
In the dark
For I was born with a wolf in my heart
A wolf in my heart

Heidevolk - Drink met de Goden (Walhalla)

Sinds de dag van mijn bestaan
Leerde ik de zege volgen
Nam het zwaard van vader aan
En vulde mijn leven
Met vieren en vechten
Geen pul kon mij besten
Bodemloos, tomeloos
De roes der zege dreef me voort
Onstuimig en in strijd gedoopt
Ik ken geen angst voor de dood
In de hal waar mede vloeit
Drink ik met de goden
(Walhalla)
Feest ik in hun hallen
(Walhalla)
Ik nam haar hand
Zij gaf mij nieuw leven
Daar op mijn vaders land
Daar vond ik de vrede
En in de grote hal
Vertelden wij verhalen
Van zege en van strijd
De roem van onze daden

Het volk verhaalt van onze faam
En nageslacht draagt mijn naam
In de hal waar mede vloeit
Drink ik met de goden
(Walhalla)
Feest ik in hun hallen
(Walhalla)
Sterk tot het einde
Staand tot aan de laatste man
Ik botvier mijn lusten
Niets dat mij weerhouden kan
Oh drink met de goden en feest in hun hallen
Oh drink met de goden en feest in hun hallen
Oh drink met de goden en feest in hun hallen
Oh drink met de goden en feest in hun hallen
Ziet deze strijder hoort hem nu aan
Hij kerfde zijn sage, zijn levensverhaal
Zocht steeds naar de zege, ver van zijn land
En danste door steden die hij had verbrand
Urth spon haar draden en bracht hem weerom
Hij vond zijn bestaan alwaar hij ooit begon
Omringt door zijn sibbe, bij 't vuur van zijn haard
Vond hij de vrede en rustte zijn zwaard

En als ik val, in mijn laatste strijd
Word ik door Walkuren geleid
En drink ik met de goden
(Walhalla)
Feest ik in hun hallen
(Walhalla)
(Walhalla)
Sterk tot het einde
(Walhalla)
Staand tot aan de laatste man
(Walhalla)
Ik botvier mijn lusten
(Walhalla)
Niets dat mij weerhouden kan

A boy gone astray
Deceived by a God
Remembers the day
Bereft of his blood
Much too your dismay
Now equal we meet
Self righteous repay
You kneel by my feet, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I seek what you took
I promise you'll pay
By hook or by crook
A boy gone astray, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword
I stand

By the sword in my hand

Those who question the sword in my hand

Happens to include my own superiority

Kneel before me now or I will have your head for heresy

Ik kok mien potjen op een werkende vulkaan
Een dinosauris nuum ik een halve haan

Een maffe professor die had van mien geheurd
En kwam op zien Solex noar de Achterhoek gescheurd
Met camera's en lasso's maakt ze jacht op mien
Moar mien hol is nooit ontdekt en gin mens hef mien gezien
Ik bun een woar kampioen
In een echt visioen
Ik bun Vulgaris Magistralis
En ik ri-j op een mammoet in 't rond

En op zondag op een mastodont

Ik sluup deur de bossen van de Achterhoek
Zie wilt mien strikken veur 't witte doek
Bi-j nacht en ontij kom ik uut mien hol
Mies Bouwman en Spielberg wilt mien in de hoofdrol
Moar zie kriegt mien niet

En de vrouwtjes bewerk ik met mien knots

Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For, you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much


Foreign life forms, inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed, foretold, but who would suspect?
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hangin' up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry

Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way, I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, uh, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death

Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way, I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, uh, blow me away

Who's to say what's for me to say?
Who's to say what's for me to be?
Who's to say what's for me to do?
'Cause a big nothin' it'll be for me


The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel

I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you 'round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You'll feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death

Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs "Do you kill on God's command?"
A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland
Holy wars...

Upon my podium as the “know-it-all” scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Upon my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the “holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger” of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way, they die... they die!


They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!



Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away

1 ContributorOrion’s Light LyricsThe winters come Its cold outside
The centuries pass with no end in sight
The light of the stars is fading from your eyes
And now
The path back to Ithaca’s’ gone
The gods have left him all alone
Cursed to remain in oblivion for all time
For his crime
Thinking that he was divine
Lost in a dream of an endless story
Cursed with ship on an windless sea
Searching for stars that will end his journey
When will I be free
Look to the sky for the winters comet
Follow the stars and the moon to free
The sails of night
And sail on orions light

The sun has set upon the sea
His eyes are now old he can barely see
The light that once guided him fades upon
The waves of time

The strength that once drove him has gone
The dark is reclaiming its throne
And all that is left is the memory of her

-bridge-
Take my life he screams
Without my eyes im just a memory
A soul lost at sea for eternity
Lost for all time
Lost in a dream of an endless story
Cursed with ship on an windless sea
Searching for stars that will end his journey
When will I be free
Look to the sky for the winters comet
Follow the stars and the moon to free
The sails of night
And sail on orions light
“Curse you all 
What is my crime ? ive done your biding
Ive done your will , why have you forsaken me
It was glory I sought
-“Its glory we want”
Glory I delivered
-“Glory not for you”
Release me to my fate

“Lost in a dreams neverending story
On a ship on an windless sea
Without stars an endless journey
How can I be free
Look to the sky for the winters comet
Lighting the path bright for you to see
Hold the memory of her smile
For love will set you free”
It will set you free
Your journeys over
Sail on the light from the winters comet
Burn bright in the sky for all to see
Her destiny and love will set you free

Moonlight Haze - It's Insane


It's been a couple of days now since it all has begun
Something has changed inside me and there is much going on
I Just cannot see the world the way that I did before
I'm sick and tired of distress, I always worry too much

I want to live my days like after one glass of good wine
When you're still sober but bad thoughts start to leave from your mind
I can perceive every atom of this body of mine
It might sound silly but hey, I know at least I should try

Flames and fire spitting sparks inside my soul
It all seems so right to me although I know...

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel thе flames, no more pain
Nevеr felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain

It's like the first ray of sun after a week in the dark
My fears are melting away, I know they've left a deep mark
It all unravels so easily from this new perspective
Oh, Freedom is so addictive!

Flames and fire through my veins, sparks in my eyes
This is how I want to live even if I realize...

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain
Uh, it's insane!


It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
That's the way of the world
So I'm ready to glow
I will go with the flow from now on

I want to live my days like after one glass of good wine
I won't let the embers die
I won't give up my fire

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
No remorse, let it go
Because life is too short
It's insane, and again
There's this melody stuck in my brain

It's insane, I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
Fuel the flames, no more pain
Never felt so alive!
That's the way of the world
So I'm ready to glow
I'll just go with the flow
And let life take its course from now on

Alestorm - Pirate Metal Drinking Crew


Go

This is the tale of a world gone wrong
A history without a song
The threads of meaning lost to me
We're blind to what we cannot see
Aeons ago when the ancients ruled
Otyg and Lumsk, celebrating yule
But then the damn pirates came along and said
"Yo ho ho, you're fucking dead"

Now your world's crashing down, only one can survive
It's time you woke up and realized

We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
Fuck you

Woo!

Sailing the seas of the distant past
We're on a quest to kick your ass
With cannon fire and battle cry
Your mighty legacy will die
The blood of Blackbeard in our veins
We're bringing slaughter, death and pain
There's no escape, tonight you're screwed
'Cause we're the pirate metal drinking crew

Across the seven seas
For a thousand years
We're your greatest wish
We're your darkest fear

We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
Fuck you


We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We think you're dumb and we hate you too
We are the pirate metal drinking crew
We don't give a fuck, we think you all suck
Fuck you

Alestorm - Alestorm

4th track on Alestorm album No Grave but the Sea, the song is curiously titled after the name of the band itself.

In fact the song talks about all things Alestorm are about: in Alestorm’s own words…
… Read More 
Go
A storm is coming
The cold is mind numbing
Darkness is Descending
Death
There's no escaping
We're all anticipating smashing your brains tonight (Ya-har)
Firing the cannons and raising the flag
This is the piratical way
Under the sign of the storm of ale
Soon with your lives you will pay

Go
We're losing our minds
Into the barrel and drink what we find

Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale
Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale

Rum, the finest potion
It gives me quite the notion
To vomit over your face
Beer, so cold as ice
It's taste will suffice
Drinking through nights and through days
Quest, this is the meaning of life
The voyage into the unknown
A tankard of mead, is all that I need
To enter the partying zone

Go
We're out of control
Escape from your brain to the depths of your soul

Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale
Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale

Go
We're losing our minds
Into the barrel and drink what we find
No, there's no turning back
Ready for battle, it's time to attack

Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale
Rum, beer, quests, and mead
These are things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag, and let's set sail
Under the sign of the storm of ale

Alestorm - Under Blackened Banners


Five thousand years ago in the age of dinosaurs
A single voice of chaos spoke in a tongue not heard before
Heed my words o denizens of protoplasmic slime
I wield the pirate scepter, this wretched world is mine

And from the slime rose up an army of the damned
Black banners in the sky prepared for the command

Raise your hook
Raise your sword
Fight the world and face the horde
We're the brotherhood of pirates
We’re the sisters of the sea
Sailing under blackened banners
Stealing ships and getting hammered
The destiny of piracy
Belongs to you and me

I am the heart of the conspiracy
A secret forged in mystery
From a time before the oceans spanned the globe
Beneath the flag of death I conquer
All those who would defy
The storm has come, black banners fill the sky

Raise your hook
Raise your sword
Fight the world and face the horde
We're the brotherhood of pirates
We're the sisters of the sea
Sailing under blackened banners
Stealing ships and getting hammered
The destiny of piracy
Belongs to you and me

We are one
We are all
We are never gonna fall
To the end of all eternity we’ll stand against the law
And now the land lies dead from centuries of war
The protoplasmic pirate horde will rise to fight once more
"This moment marks not the end of your mortal life
Nor is it the final chapter in your legacy
This is the beginning of your transcorporeal existence!"

Raise your hook
Raise your sword
Fight the world and face the horde
We're the brotherhood of pirates
We're the sisters of the sea
Sailing under blackened banners
Stealing ships and getting hammered
Our history, our legacy
The force that sets the spirit free
The destiny of piracy
Belongs to you and me

Alestorm - Voyage of the Dead Marauder


I am the one who bears the mark of vengeance
Branded on my skin
I am the one who sails the endless horizon
To the land that lies within
I am the one who died, so many years ago
You know this surely to be true
I am the hunger you no longer feel
I am the voice inside of you

Cross the void
Voyage to the other side

Sail away, dead marauder
Stormy seas guide your way
We are yet to see another golden day
Your star will nеver fade
Nevеr stray, dead marauder
From the path you have made
'Til we meet again to make the final raid
Destroy the ashes of the world

Across the threshold of eternity
We'll travel hand in hand
One last voyage to the unfamiliar land

For many years I carved a path of destruction
Across the raging seas
For many years I sought to find the answer
But the truth escaped from me

Lost to time
Are the answers you will never find

Sail away, dead marauder
Stormy seas guide your way
We are yet to see another golden day
Your star will never fade
Never stray, dead marauder
From the path you have made
'Til we meet again to make the final raid
Destroy the ashes of the world


I have seen the coming darkness drift across the land
I have seen your proud ambitions slip away like sand
I have seen the end of things that have not come to be
I will be the dead marauder, pirate of the seas

Sail away
Stormy seas will guide your way
Cross the void
Voyage to the other side

Sail away, dead marauder
Stormy seas guide your way
We are yet to see another golden day
Your star will never fade
Never stray, dead marauder
From the path you have made
'Til we voyage down below the waves
To lands that lie beyond the grave and
Meet again to make the final raid

Brothers of Metal - Heavy Metal Viking


Woke up this morning, my shield in hand
Woke up the fellas in my metal band
I am a Viking, I am a god (She is a god)
Better believe it or I'll tear you apart

Brothers and sisters, let the rocking commence

Some may call me crazy, they know nothing at all
'Cause I'm a heavy metal Viking and I'm on a roll
See me rollin' in my long boat, you'll go out of control
I got a heavy metal Viking soul, huh


My quest is simple, my aim is true
Destiny's calling, babe, I'm coming for you
I'll make you moan, then I'll be gone
I'll end up sitting in a giant metal throne

On the first day, Odin created rock

Some may call me crazy, they know nothing at all
'Cause I'm a heavy metal Viking and I'm on a roll
See me rollin' in my long boat, you'll go out of control
I got a heavy metal Viking soul, uh


My father is a mountain, my mother is the sea
And where the ocean meets the shore is where I came to be
I'm the perfect combination of magic and fantasy
I'm too good to be
I'm all you can imagine times infinity, times three
Just join me in my quest, your faith in me will set you free
Half man, half rock, half dream
I'm probably the best you'll ever see
Rock


I am the ruler, above all
Get that, or get the **** away **** from my **** hall
I am eternal, got abs of stone
'Cause I am fueled by testosterone

For those about to rock, we salute you

You know that some may call me crazy, they know nothing at all
'Cause I'm a heavy metal Viking and I'm on a roll
See me rollin' in my long boat, you'll go out of control
I got a heavy metal Viking soul, yeah

(Viking)
Viking is not a choice, it's a way of life
(Viking)
To drink a barrel of mead without taking a break
(Viking)
To fight with any weapon combination
(Viking)
To cleave your best friends with a great axe
(Heavy metal in the night)
(Viking)

Brothers of Metal - Nanna's Fate


By the stars, following the heart
Her dreams were set ablaze beneath the moon
What life unites divinity divided
A wordless pain in pale blue seas and skies

In life, in death
I will walk beside you
In life, through death
Wherever you go

Our love is on fire
Laying my life next to yours
Into darkness we will wander but never alone
I will fight for you
When the goddess claims your soul
I know death is not final

Unyielding grief like an open wound
The end of life was not the end for them
The one true love - like an endless fire (like an endless fire)
Embraced by death in misery forever more

In life, in death
I will walk beside you
In life, through death
Wherever you go

Our love is on fire
Laying my life next to yours
Into darkness we will wander but never alone
I will fight for you
When the goddess claims your soul
I know death is not final


Travel beyond, realm of the unknown
Into the nether where hope yields no power at all
Staying alive, enter illusions of light
We'll be sharing one breath, through darkness and death
I know death is not final

Equilibrium - Gnosis

Look around you and don’t act blind
Foolish people with empty minds
Look around you and see them crying
A pleasure to watch? Cause they are dying!
We'll turn the world on fire
With the lights of ancient flames
We are gods, convey us prayers
Yet gnosis will remain
We'll bring you pain and chaos
With promise of new lives
New worlds, new times arise
Gnosis alone remains
Beneath the surface, secrets hide
Within the crowd, their tears they bide
Masked emotions, they deny
In their solitude, they silently cry
We'll turn the world on fire
With the lights of ancient flames
We are gods, convey us prayers
Yet gnosis will remain
We'll bring you pain and chaos
With promise of new lives
New worlds, new times arise
Gnosis alone remains

The world is turning, the world is burning
The world is turning, the world is burning
The world is turning, the world is burning
The world is turning, the world is burning
We'll turn the world on fire
With the lights of ancient flames
We are gods, convey us prayers
Yet gnosis will remain
We'll bring you pain and chaos
With promise of new lives
New worlds, new times arise
Gnosis alone remains

Five Finger Death Punch - AfterLife


I've heard the rumors that the rumors all were true
They may be looking for me (They may be looking for me)
But they're coming for you (But they're coming for you)
I'll paint a picture you can better understand
They promise diamonds (They promise diamonds)
But they pay in sand

It goes on and on and on and on and on
It's an old, broken record stuck on the same song
It goes on and on and on and on and on
You all know it's wrong, but you're singing along

(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna have to wait for the fall

I don't wanna wait for heaven to change things
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for hеaven to change this
I don't wanna have to fall on thе knife
(I don't wanna wait)
Forever after, this disaster

You'd cut your nose off just to spite your fuckin' face
That's who you are (That's who you are)
You know your place (You know your place)
You let them lead you by the throat with broken hands
So how's the view beneath their shoe (and what's your plan?)

Nyt on aika laittaa hihat heilumaan
Soita poika soita
Rankarummun tahtiin
Revi harmonikkaa
Että väki innoissaan
Soita poika soita rankarummun tahtiin

Syvän unen, rajani
Käen kuiskauksen, sanani
Tuulenvireessä kesän
Kuunvalon kajossa
Kesäyön, taikani
Viisaudet, lauluuni
Mut lauluni se soi vain ikävästä
Kuulen kuvan, kaivattuni
Etsiskelen, säkeitäni
Lauluni tästä, hulluuden hämärästä
Nuottikota, kummulla
Siellä puiden katveessa
Savu nuotion tuoksuu jo tänne tullessa

Nyt on aika laittaa hihat heilumaan

Revitään silleen, että ryyppään laittaa raittiin
Soita poika soita rankarummun tahtiin
Hakataan ne ikävän halot vähän sassiin
Soita poika soita, soita poika soita!

Ehtoo laskee hyvänä
Ei häivää ikävästä
Varmaankin tuuli nukkuu
Jo suon äyräällä
Äkkiä kajahtaa soimaan
Laulunsa, uljaana
Kaikki tulen värit, keltaista ja punaista
Kohtalo ei kipitä, ohitsemme ikinä
Meillä graniitin kasvot on hymyinä
Vaakakuppi hyppysissä
Olispa ollut viisautta
Tarpeiden mestari
Ja huudan veljet

Nyt on aika laittaa hihat heilumaan
Soita poika soita
Rankarummun tahtiin
Revi harmonikkaa

Sieltä ehtootähti hohtaa hopeaa
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Kun lehtojen hämyssä
Soivat laulut ankarat
Ovat tuskin perillä
Kun he sinne kaatuivat
Pojat äidein armaimmat
Siihen rinta rinnan juoksivat
Suoraan vastatuleen
Ison tammen juureen
Pehmoinen, hento villa
On valkolampahilla
Aurinko paistaa yllä
Komean kotomaan
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Sieltä ehtootähti hohtaa hopeaa
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Niin mä näen tämän komean kotomaan
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Tuli palavana loimuu muinainen
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Siispä kaiu, laulu uljas kultainen!

On tammen alla hiljaista
Kun tuli ehti riipaista
Nyt kurjet saapuvat
Ja tikka takoo tammessa
Ajan jälkeen ei mikään vaivaa
Ei tuskaa, joka kaivaa
Oi kallis syntymämaa
Pehmoinen hento villa
On valkolampahilla
Aurinko paistaa yllä
Komеan kotomaan
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Sieltä еhtootähti hohtaa hopeaa
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Niin mä näen tämän komean kotomaan
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Tuli palavana loimuu muinainen
Sininen taivas ja valkoinen maa
Siispä kaiu, laulu uljas kultainen!
Eteenpäin on pakko päästä enkä tulivoimaa säästä
Edessäni lentää maa
Vaan periksi ei antaa saa!

Reppu rähjäinen, soratietä suus?
Onko matka ollut pitkä vaiko siintääkö silmääs lokoisa tulevaisuus?
Siellä mullikat jo mettäs luikkivat
Samaan aikaan joutsenet kun saapuvat:
Vastas reissunpäältä rihmo, äijän rähjä, sylkee suusta sätkäsen ja räkäsee:
Aita kaatuu jos on seipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on risunenkin aitaus kun ilman
Aita kaatuu jos on seipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on airan vittankin kun kuivin suin
Ettikkönä sarkaa vai työkö sinnuu jahtaa?
Ookko saanu viljaa niin kun laiska paskaa?
Onko matka ollut turha vaiko painaako repussa kultana omaisuus?
Ei niin huanoo hiahoo ole näkynyt, johon ei komeinkin härkä vääntynyt
Vastas reissunpäältä rihmo, äijän rähjä, sylkee suusta sätkäsen ja räkäsee:
Aita kaatuu jos on seipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on risunenkin aitaus kun ilman
Aita kaatuu jos on seipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on airan vittánkin kun kuivin suin
Ookko saanu tien neuvvoo enempi kun leipää?
Onko tullu vierahasta surko?
Onko jätetty sut risuaitain taa sinne minne ei naisen silmäkään saa?

Jotta on sitä köyhälläkin annettavaa, jos ei muuta niin rakkavuutta vaan
Vastas reissun päältä rihmo, äijän rähjä, sylkee suusta sätkäsеn ja räkäsee:
Aita kaatuu jos on seipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on risunenkin aitaus kun ilman
Aita kaatuu jos on sеipäät liian pitkät
Parempi on airan vittänkin kun kuivin suin

Korpiklaani - Saunaan

Missä valkoiset koivut ne humajaa
Ja rannan harmaissa kivissä solajaa
Siellä paksuimman kuusenrunko narahtaa
"Nyt se kaatuu!" korpimies parahtaa
Kohta kaadettu pölliä korvellinen
Ja janojuomana nautittu saavillinen
Pää märkänä, selkää jo kolottaa
"Kiuas kuumaksi!" Nyt äijät saunaan
Tulta pesään vaan
Ja halko roihahtaa!
Saunaan lähdetään joka ukko huutaa
"Tuokaa sitä sahtii ja jekkua kuumaa"
Saunaan, ei tarvi kohmelossa luuhaa
Kun lauteet on täynnä ja kiuas on kuuma
Saunaan siellon riemuu ja rauhaa
Kopallinen oltta ja tulipesä pauhaa
Aamulla vasta pelti on kii
Joten kastele vasta ja ala hutkii!
Koivunoksista vitsat väännettiin
Ja rantakivista kiuas kasattiin
Korpimiehellä raskas on työ
"Hanskat naulaan!" Ja Irtoaa vyö

Savu silmissä alkaa jo kirvelee
Ja tuliliemi kurkussa polttelee
Joku jäähylle ovenkahvaa hamuaa
"Löylyt karkaa" lauteilta raikaa
Lisää halkoa vaan
Me kyllä koko yö vihdotaan!
Saunaan lähdetään joka ukko huutaa
"Tuokaa sitä sahtii ja jekkua kuumaa"
Saunaan, ei tarvi kohmelossa luuhaa
Kun lauteet on täynnä ja kiuas on kuuma
Saunaan siellon riemuu ja rauhaa
Kopallinen oltta ja tulipesä pauhaa
Aamulla vasta pеlti on kii
Joten kastele vasta ja ala hutkii!

Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

You will pay for what you've done

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!

Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites!

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes

I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

Your time has come to be replaced

Linkin Park - Heavy Is the Crown


It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside, I know

Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back thеn should've bit your tongue
'Cause thеre's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the

Blood On the Dance Floor - Beat It


They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it, ah ah
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it, beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, beat it)

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)
Beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)

I'm a killer, a chiller
A bone-a-field thriller
Open you up, like a bottle of miller
Drink but don't hate
Kiss and just taste (Sweeth)
Gotta burn it like heat
When I'm kickin' up this beat
We will dance in your defeat
We don't want no effin beef
We just came here for some peace
So let it just be
Dancing to the street
Living up thic mic
I will love it up like

Charnel Deity
Imminence Of The Final Punishment
Satan is the master deceiver
And the father of lies
Pulling blindfold over Christians eyes
Destined to burn in the fires
Driven through caverns of hades
Foul demands gnaw at your flesh
Your mortal life is taken from you
But your soul will never rest
I give my command
Thousands shall fall
Wasted lives
I'll take them all
Fire, I'll burn your flesh 'till death
Sadistic lust for terror
Charred to mere consciousness
Hatred strives forever
I give my command
Thousands shall fall
Wasted lives
I'll take you all

Take the wretched lives
Of those who'd thwart your will
Foredoomed to suffer
Their worthless blood we shall spill
Damned by your weakness
You denied your evil side
New dog in priestly white
You have nowhere to hide

Dirty Loops - Rolling in the Deep

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
It's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out
And I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And its bring me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
It Reminds you of the home we shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all it all
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Lorenzo Licitra - Somebody That I Used To Know

1 ContributorSomebody That I Used To Know Lyrics
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
And you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody
(I used to know)
Somebody
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody
(I used to know)
Somebody
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)

Machine Head - These Scars Won't Define Us

1 ContributorThese Scars Won’t Define Us Lyrics
One life is all that you
One life is all that you get

A dread comes over me in moments of my weakness
It suffocates me as I contemplate the bleakness
Head to the grindstone, power forward through the endless dark
Focus determination, on this world I'll leave a mark
It took so long for any confidence to get in here
And now the question that I need to know, I cannot hear

I can’t give you the proof
But music is the truth

One lifе, these scars they won't dеfine us
One chance, to strengthen ties that bind us
One love, to show the world meaning
Remember before you forget
(One life is all that you)
One life is all that you get

The time has come for me to let go of my grudges
Power and strength will come to clear the path before us
Quiet the voices, in my head, sometimes they never stop
Dig for my confidence, keep going till I fucking drop
Don't waste a moment, every second precious, seize the day
No time to rest on laurels, sleep will come when in the grave

I can’t give you the proof
But music is the truth

One life, these scars they won't define us
One chance, to strengthen ties that bind us
One love, to show the world meaning
Remember before you forget
(One life is all that you)
One life is all that you get


Hope, don't let them bury the hope
The wicked won't reap what they sow
The cynics they need to see light
So stand up and show them what's right
Don't let them bury the hope
The wicked won't reap what they sow
The cynics they need to see light
So stand up and show them what's right
One life, these scars they won’t define us
One chance, to strengthen ties that bind us (ties that bind)
One love, to show the world meaning
Remember before you forget
(One life is all that you get)
One life, these scars they won’t define us (won't define)
One chance, to strengthen ties that bind us (ties that bind)
One love, to show the world meaning
Remember before you forget
(One life is all that you)
One life is all that you get

Æther Realm - The Sun, the Moon, the Star



Long been complacent with the hand I've been dealt
Restless and weak, from the life that I've built
So I'll journey afar, for there's glory to find
And I'll fill out my entry in the annals of time
Bid my farewell to the ones that I love
Their grief but a fleeting feeling
For nature is calling, my heart compelled
Every branch, every leaf, has a story to tell


Fear is swirling within me
A tightening grip on my heart
In a world where nothing is certain
The fear of failure looms large, oh
No room for these doubts
I'll cast them away and take up my father's sword
History favors the daring
Only the brave will receive the eternal reward


Will you be here ready to guide me?
When I must leave this dream behind me?
A beacon of hope, but fading away
I have to let that light die, let it die


Mother, Father, Sister
I'm sorry for what I've done
But the man I've become is no longer content with comfort
And home


Cold is the wind that chills me down to my bones
And cold is the knowledge that for this I abandoned my home
Cold is my sorrow, like a knife in my chest
And cold is the path that I chose
For what worth can be found in glory in the lands that I roam

Raise your eyes, cast your gaze high
And forget your sorrows


Cold is the wind that chills me down to my bones
And cold is the knowledge that for this I abandoned my home
Cold is my sorrow, like a knife in my chest
And cold is the path that I walk
But I carry those memories close to my heart
And remember them fondly when I gaze at
The sun, the moon, stars


So we'll find our dreams fade in time
Oh, in time our dreams leave us blind
Leave us blind


By moonlight and starlight
Those shadows led me astray
Take comfort in darkness
Hide me away from the light


Hide with me from the light my child
I'll show you another way
Burn away your sorrow in the cleansing fire of power

Power

Colors swirling around me
Shifting landscapes obey my every command
But still I don't possess the power to fill the emptiness

Swallow and take what you thought you were meant to be
And reconcile it with who you are
Another lesson learned in time, but oh, you'll find
You don't know what you want until it's gone


I've hailed to the cosmic masters
I've walked the astral plane and traveled to distant worlds
Time like a river flows
The one thing I don't have the power to change
The only thing that matters


Mother, Father, Sister
I'm sorry for what I've done
For the man I've become
Finally knows the true power in home


A broken legacy, a tale of tragedy
Take heed my friends
The path of pain isn't always
The means to the end you seek


By moonlight and starlight
I turn my gaze to the sky

The sun, the moon, the stars
Shine less brightly with you so far
I never knew sorrow
'til you asked me to follow my heart
For all the tales I told
And these whispers of silver and gold
I'd throw them all away
To gaze on your face once more
One more time
The sun, the moon, the stars
Shine less brightly with you so far
I never knew sorrow
'til you asked me to follow my heart
For all the tales I told
And these whispers of silver and gold
I'd throw them all away
To gaze on your face once more
One more time
The sun, the moon, the stars
Shine less brightly with you so far (With his burning brand, he split the skies)
I never knew sorrow 'til you asked me to follow my heart (And blocked out the stars, one by one)
For all the tales I told
And these whispers of silver and gold (With an aching heart, he cursed his name)
I'd throw them all away
To gaze on your face once more (And nothing would shine as bright as her again)

Oh my god, are you somebody?
Swear I'm your biggest fan
I used to like all the old shit
Before you sold out to the man
I never bought the album
I never saw you live
So you can play anything you want
As long as it's the shit I like

So you wanna be somebody?
Kid, we can take you far
We'll getcha thinking who you could be
And forget about who you are
Don't you wanna pay your rent on time?
Accumulate your wealth?
Kid, you can be anything you want
As long as it's somebody else
Head down
By sorrow found again
Let down
I hold the crown
And it's driving my out of my fucking mind

Should I surrender?
What have I got to lose?
You can break yourself but they still won't cry for you
And if I resist it
What am I trying to prove?
When you face yourself can you meet your eye?
If you hate yourself till the day you die, should I?
Should I surrender?
The tide of battle ever turning
Defeat to victory
Should I surrender?
What have I got to lose?
You can break yourself but they will not cry for you
And if I resist it
What am I trying to prove?
When you face yourself can you meet your eye?
If you hate yourself till the day you die, should I
Surrender?
What have I got to lose?
You can break yourself but they will not cry for you
And if I resist it
What am I trying to prove?
When you face yourself can you meet your eye?
If you hate yourself til' the day you die, should I
Surrender?
Should I surrender?
Should I surrender?

Go!

The dream stealer comes at night
Sneaks into our minds so deep
Silent, sly, and out of sight
A mental parasite
Takes the hopes we hold so dear
Corrupts our hearts with doubts and fear
Makes us question all we know
Fills our minds with sorrow's flow

Dream stealer knows our thoughts
Turns them into twisted knots
Takes the light that shines within
Leaves us lost in shadows dim

Dream stealer
It creeps and crawls
Dream stealer
A shadow self that constantly calls

It whispers lies into our minds
And twists the truth 'til we are blind


It tells us we are not enough
Makes us feel like we are stuck
Steals the passion that we crave
Fills our souls with empty graves

Dream stealer knows our thoughts
Turns them into twisted knots
Takes the light that shines within
Leaves us lost in shadows dim

Dream stealer
It creeps and crawls

A shadow self that constantly calls
Dream stealer
With twisted claws

And twists the truth 'til we are blind
It creeps and crawls

The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go
Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate
Odin! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east
Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns
A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow

It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die
Odin! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip

Amon Amarth - War of the Gods


War, the very first war of our world
When the treacherous wench was killed
Three times burned and three times born
By searing flames was Gullveig torn
Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
Battle horns gave off their sound
And Asgard was razed to the ground

The Vanir felt deceived, Hænir was a fool
Without Mímir at his side, Hænir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage, Mímir's blood was shed
And to Odin's court, they sent Mímir's severed head

Truce, so a brittle and frail ease was forged
Into a shattered piece to make
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
And Hænir and Mímir to Vanaheim
Death, see the furious gods washed in blood
And Odin knew that the way to war
Would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain

Odin tog huvudet och smorde det med örter
Som hindrar det från att ruttna
Han kvad sina trollsånger över det
Så att Mimer åter kunde tala till honom

The Vanir felt deceived, Hænir was a fool
Without Mímir at his side, Hænir could not rule

As the first light touched the waves
And the ravens cawed across the bay
A mighty fleet with red white sails
Three hundred viking ships were on their way

War!

With thirst for blood and all out war
A thirst that's aching through our hearts and bones
We're heading west to distant shores
To avenge our father and to win the throne
They think their god will save their skin
But all resistance will be in vain
We stare at death with crimson grins
With Odin's help we cannot fail

We hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as we stand side by side
As long as we can see the ravens fly
Ravens fly
Ravens fly

War!

Heading to Northumbraland
Come what may, we won't back down
When horns of war begin to sound
Aella's head will lose its crown

Come what may, we hold our heads up to the sky
And know that we will never die
As long as Odin's on our side

We hold our heads up to the sky

Whirling dust in morning air, two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends, not enemies

They lash out with ferocious force
The fight grows more intense
But each avoid the other's sword as if by seventh sense
Their muscles ache, their bones are sore
But none of them will yield
They fight a two-man practice war as enemies

It's the way of the Jomsvikings

Before the Dawn - Wrath

Restart
Ignite with brand new hate
Inhale the pain
Deny the blame
Beat them sore
This is not a metaphor
Black machinery with tons of steel breaking free
One man genocide
Legion in one heavily armed
My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn
Withdraw behind your own lines
Pull back the men
The ones who went and slaved my queen
This is for them to see
They bleed
The same blood that painted my dreams
The blood of my enemies
My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn

My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn

Bloodred Hourglass - Where the Sinners Crawl

I can smell the fear and weakness
See right through inside your soul
I can dwell in silent secrets
Mirror tell my tale no more
I've stayed so lost with all this hate
I've lost my faith to make the change
Relentless, I am reachless
We rise, we fall
In hope we carry on
Punched me through the flames
I'm not afraid to die,watch me burn afar
In this given time until I'm done
When my eyse close
When the silence blindfolds
I will reset the glory in my heart
I can see it in my eyse of redemption
As a devil of the ride
The second when I sought for a shelter
Only found a cage to hide
In the middle of your saints
A demon needs to be chased
I see you try me

Punched me through the flames
I'm not afraid to die, watch me burn afar
In this given time until I'm done
When my eyes close
When the silence blindfolds
I will reset the glory in my heart
As much as nothing left to hide
One of the last ones left to save
I see the end has just begun
I kiss you one more last-goodbye
Punched me through the flames
I'm not afraid to die, watch me burn afar
In this given time until I'm done
When my eyse close
When the silence blindfolds
I will reset the glory in my heart
There are reapers and angels
Drifting to share to the way
Right here where the sinners crawl
We fall out of shades,all the desperate ways
Resolve-Future as great unknown

Bloodred Hourglass - Veritas


The days I was the forgotten
In the lack of all tragedy
You set our ships on fire
And watch them burn with me

I just want to feel
Got a bit of reason for all this time
Or maybe in this sadness
The mistake I left alive

You know how much I could just hate you
But in the end my heart obeys you

Crossed the line
Veritas buried in lies
Keep reaching for your love
Save me from this all
Carry me on
Catalyst that will brace my soul
Trapped inside this lust
Useless on tomorrow

If the pages can't be turned
I know, I know the book can't be learned
If I leave you on my reading list (forever)
I know you'll be my mental apocalypse

Crossed the line
Veritas buried in lies
Keep reaching for your love
Save me from this all
Carry me on
Catalyst that will brace my soul
Trapped inside this lust
Useless on tomorrow

Crossed the line
Veritas buried in lies
Keep reaching for your love
Save me from this all
Carry me on
Catalyst that will brace my soul
Trapped inside this lust
Useless on tomorrow

Don't need you to say it to me, don't need you to understand
I just wanna feel like there is something more than what we have
Crossed the line
Veritas buried in lies
Reaching for the love
Useless on tomorrow

Bloodred Hourglass - Waves of Black


The truth we all hide from
When trapdoor swings out from
Beneath your feet you'll find the
Bottomless free fall
It's nothing superior
We're only inferior
Come hell or high water
There is the greed for more

So tempted to close our eyes
Pretend that we're safe and sound
But when we are lost
There is no one left for the search of us

This is the universe not made for me
And this is the universe, not made for you
We are the paradox, we can't live forever
In the waves of black
Where the dead whales can't wave back

It's a system of balance
We are disguise of reality
It's a conflict and health
We are friends, we are enemies


But every time I take a look at us
It's like the wisdom is forbidden in us
We are no reason of creation
But a humiliation

So tempted to close our eyes
Pretend that we're safe and sound
But when we are lost
There is no one left for the search of us

This is the universe not made for me
And this is the universe, not made for you
We are the paradox, we can't live forever
In the waves of black
Where the dead whales can't wave back

Dead whales can't wave back

Bloodred Hourglass - Devourer


Stuck inside a downward spiral
Out of all this mental disgrace
You're something more
Follow me, I'll show you the early grave
Like a portrait for the diseased
Paint the picture of me

Sitting on a throne of grace
I do not beat my own heart
The only thing here not so vague
We cannot live forever
If you seek for your salvation
All you have is a tribulation
Just hold onto your fucking self

We don't even know ourselves
The mirrors show no permanence
Our house is turning into a grave so
We close the curtains for the change

All vague, are we awake?
When you look back, asking, begging for more
I'm sure you knew that it's all gone wrong
When you are lost and only begging for hope
I'm sure you'll comfort from
Starting a fight, a doom in a mind
Whatever you do, keep begging the skies like
Our humans with no humanity

We don't even know ourselves
The mirrors show no permanence
Our house is turning into a grave so
We close the curtains for the change

When you look up, asking "Are we alone?"
I'm sure you know that it's not too far
When you are lost and only begging for rope
I'm sure you'll comfort from
Keeping it tight, the vision in sight
Whatever you do, keep begging the lies might
Give a shit about the reckoning

We don't even know ourselves
The mirrors show no permanence
Our house is turning into a grave so
We close the curtains
We hide the certain

Our hearts are the countdown clocks
Just clicking into being done
Our minds are the counters of this
Loneliness, the death will devour

Bloodred Hourglass - Alysia


Did you hear the rumble of the morning rain?
Did I always stay alone, awake, all in vain?
Do you still wait there for me?
As I will 'till the end of our days

I'm not sure I feel all sane
I lack this bitter but it's all the same
There's not much left from me
But the words of this serenade

Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will

With coldest heart that's buried deep
My last words in voiceless sound of sleep
I've done, given all my everything
Could you kill the grief and turn this into sweet relief?

Until my last inhale we'll breathe the same air
As we will dance
This one last serenade

Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will


Take my hand and hold onto me
As we face the last break of dawn
Together we drift to the unknown
Hold my hand in this one last serenade

Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will

Did we run into the hearts of the great unknown?
Did we ever choose to choke in fire?
Did we only hide the truth in the lies and silence?
Take my hand, hold onto me
As we face the sweet relief

Bloodred Hourglass - August


Goodbye, my sunshine, my love
Goodbye, my sunshine, my love

Such a trait
You rant us, there's no right to choose
Spilled the blood, took a stain in your own book
Across the pages, over the edges
You know the world could do without you
We all know there was more than this
You can't deny you didn't know all that
When pushing someone to the edge
Is oppression, a decision made

It's easy for you to say
You know how some people breathe no more
Try to emphasize, feels so mesmerized
We know how things can go all so wrong

Pray, pray, your emptiness is despicable
Paralysed in your mind
Pushed August away and brought in the fall
Just fuck y'all

As we faced the final sunrise
Never knew this was the last
Goodbye, my sunshine, my love
Given it all, a hurricane
Always part of the history
So goodbye, my sunshine, my love

Let it sink in deep
Nothing will ever compare
Against the truth
The world does not have your back

There's one new pair of angel wings in heaven
So goodbye, my sunshine, my love
Just fuck y'all

As we faced the final sunrise
Never knew this was the last
Goodbye, my sunshine, my love
Given it all, a hurricane
Always part of the history
So goodbye, my sunshine, my love

Bloodred Hourglass - On My Throne


Pouring hours to silence
Cannot find my throne
What did you bring for my doom?
Sleep of a hurricane
Thanks for asking, all is fine
It's just the sound of a time in me
New dawn will bring new flood

I never meant to force my dreams
Can’t push my heart aside
Always painting my mind
With you, new dawn in sight
Roses and droseras
Cards closer to my chest
As I am waiting for you
To show the real numbers

Take a bullet, bullet, bullet to my fucking head
So much wasted time on those bridges
All really to see the day
There's a pretender on my throne
Left behind me

Take this crown, I fall right here
But I don't claim we’re never one and whole
If that's all she wrote
Forgive my lack of grace
If that's all she wrote
Forgive my lack of faith
If that's all she wrote
Forgive my lack of...
I wish that I could say
Now this was meant to be

The cold is real, guess that's all I know
The scars I feel, guess they will not go
Embracing time as I fall in life
Dethrone my presence
Decrown my heart instead
'Cause no more, no long
Thorns feel none if life's so fucking cheap

Take this crown, I fall right here
But I don't claim we’re never one and whole
If that’s all she wrote
Forgive my lack of grace
If that's all she wrote
Forgive my lack of faith
If that’s all she wrote
Forgive my lack of...
I wish that I could say
Now this was meant to be

There's a pretender on my throne
I take a bullet, bullet, bullet to my fucking head
Whenever you cannot run away with me
In the end of our road
You'll put the crown back on my throne

Bloodred Hourglass - Quiet Complaint


In this war of the angels
Like a devil I hold the king's card
Down, taken out
Guards of tongue failed on my watch
It's all fucking lost cause
Now bring in the one last storm
No need for the dagger drawn
Too far from where I belong

Of the times we tied
To the day of our demise
I now bleed this out for you
All the tears we cried
Through the vengeance we defied
Never again to be the same no more

We walked on fire
Inhaled desire
Can you recall
How it burned out in a second?
In this memory of the dead I scream this
Quiet complaint

Tearing me down now
I feel none, fucking hypocrite
New dawn bring in the thunder
It's like a rise of an ever grey sun
How long
Will I fight with this single moment?
So far
Already frozen from being so cold myself

Of the times we tied
To the day of our demise
I now bleed this out for you
All the tears we cried
Through the vengeance we defied
Never again to be the same no more

We walked on fire
Inhaled desire
Can you recall
How it burned out in a second?
In this memory of the dead I scream this
Quiet complaint

No more - please heal me

We walked on fire
Inhaled desire
Can you recall?
Can you?

We walked on fire
Inhaled desire
Can you recall
How it burned out in a second?
In this memory of the dead I scream this
Quiet complaint

No more
I want you
Not that far
Please heal me

Bloodred Hourglass - The Last of Us

We were given all once into our hands
We explored the chances to make it last
We discovered a way to integrate
We stopped, rewinded, repeated everything
Days of glory turning to extinction
Only the strong will survive this fall
Every wave is new until it breaks
They say there'll come the day
There will come the day
Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for
This is the last of us
I have prayed for the gods and seven seas
These are the last of us
I sacrificed my love and all my dreams
I have sailed from my safe harbors
Catching trade winds on my sails
And then they say there will come the day

Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for
Proud of we still stand for
They say there'll come the day
There will come the day
Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for
This is the last of us
We are the haunted, dead or alive
These are the last of us
This is where we stand 'till the end to come
This is the last of us
We are the haunted, dead or alive
These are the last of us
This is where we stand 'till the end to come
Take my hand and we end this one
We, the last of us

Bloodred Hourglass - Six Feet Savior


Where did you go now?
Where the fuck did you disappear?
Now that we need you
A glimpse of heaven right down here
You're all little far from home here

Sorrow blinded cruelty
Do we need bloody savior
No more than false fires

Where did you go now?
Why did you disappear?
Beg you to spare me or crucify me now right here
Now how we live here
How does it make you feel
When all your angels flew away in tears
Or drowned in world of fear

I will never bow to you
Like you will never bleed for me
Rule number one in life
Never be the number two
But the old habits die hard

Where did you go now?
Why did you disappear?
Beg you to spare me or crucify me now right here
Now how we live here
How does it make you feel
When you're the bringer of the storm and I am flying above
Six feet, believed to be my savior
No faith choke down on me
I find my intuition
Withering down here

If I sell you all my sins
I heal, you leave me be
Death, my salvation
Do we have a deal?

I will never bow to you
Like you will never bleed for me
Second of the rules of life
Never skip the truth of one
But the old habits die hard

Where did you go now?
Why did you disappear?
Beg you to spare me or crucify me now right here
Now how we live here
How does it make you feel
When you're the bringer of the storm and I am flying above
Six feet, believed to be my savior
No faith choke down on me
I find my intuition
Withering down right here

Bloodred Hourglass - Of Course I Still Love you


Of course I still love you

This house is on fire, I'm painting the walls
No goodbyes were said but so much was lost
It's in the letter, the words I created
This mess that I orchestrated
Brand into shell, that's all I could do?
Tear down the flow, can't defuse the truth
Forget it, and bury it, can't bare it and I get it
I just lost the best of you

Just did declare the death of it
Just to be clear, the death of me

And the universe said no
But I just cannot let go
You know I'll be hеre
Somewherе, somewhen
Of course I still love you

Changing the direction of the train
I need to fix this beating mess of my disgrace
Such hurt is shed, the bloom is dead
For the second chance, don't know what's there

I touched your scars, played with your hair
I held your hands, all I could do was stare
There was nothing I could say
That could have made you stay
And how's the heart, beating there?
Chance we had, guess no more there
There is something I can do
Let me fix me back to you
Build me back to you
Because I still love you

And the universe said no
But I just cannot let go
You know I'll be here
Somewhere, somewhen

It's written in the stars
I promised, there we are
And you know I'll be there
Always, all of my days
You know I love you
Let me fix me back to you
Because I still love you
Let me build me back to you
Of course I still love you

Bloodred Hourglass - In Lieu of Flowers


In lieu of flowers we grow
Death as a peace of mind, I hold these dreams on my own

Let it run away, the serpent's on my fucking back
Spit the venom into my heart to bring the doom back
At curtain call tonight I search for the exit light
Like night after night, oh, will we ever survive?

The fucked up fire in me needs you, the light in me
The valentine in me wants you to reign with me
That little bite on me wants you so dire with

In lieu of flowers I can send myself
With the bloom of the flowers you can send me away
As above, so below
Devotion and hope keep me crawling back to you

Was it triggered right along when we were young?
I refused to see but the light of the sun
Might've pulled a card from a pack that's full of broken hearts
Might've tried too hard, no
Did I ever let you know?

This fucked up mind in me needs your sunlight within

In lieu of flowers I can send myself
With the bloom of the flowers you can send me away
As above, so below
Devotion and hope keep me crawling back to you
In lieu of flowers I can send myself
With the bloom of the flowers you can send me away
As above, so below
Never let go 'cause your world holds the bloom of me

Love as the death of me
Love has the death of me on hold

And in lieu of these flowers
If I, if I just let you go
I can send myself
With the bloom of the flowers you can send me away
As above, so below
Devotion and hope keep me crawling back to you
In lieu of flowers I can send myself
With the bloom of the flowers you can send me away
As above, so below
Never let go
'Cause your world holds the bloom of me

Dropped down from heaven with broken wings
I tried to patch you back, was named as your king
So happy ever after, or a once about a time?
All I know is you stole this heart of mine

And just dropped it
You do you but I want you to
Keep in mind how I'd die for you
Just drop it
You do you but I want you to
Bear in mind that I'm here for you

It's undeniable and non-survivable
How we got so far to lose it all
The world was in our hands
I left you there to stand
Alone with empty hands
When we were made out of glass

You do you but I want you to
Bear in mind how I'm here for you and acknowledge
The bettеr in you brought in the better in mе
And the best of me shall bring back the best of you

It's undeniable and non-survivable
How we got so far to lose it all
The world was in our hands
I left you there to stand
Alone with empty hands
When we were made out of glass

So much was left unsaid, was left unspoken
Those questions never asked they tore us open
But I can promise you, know that this is true
Hold my hand and see me pull us through
So much was left unsaid, was left unspoken
Those questions never asked they tore us open
But I can promise you, know that this is true
Hold my hand and see me pull us through

It's undeniable and non-survivable
How we got so far to lose it all
The world was in our hands
I left you there to stand
Alone with empty hands
When we were made out of glass

With tiny fragile hands
When we were made out of glass
I'm so sorry, so so sorry, I'm so sorry
It shattered, I gave no chance
When I wasn't there to hold that hand
I wasn't there to hold that hand

Who the fuck just pulled that trigger of hell
And pushed me into this well?
Why the hell did I choose to tell
I never knew those words will ring my knells
Waiting for the world to clinch eternal sleep
Waiting for the worst I question what is real

Brace my fucking self, will I ever sleep?
Tired to fight with someone else, will I ever breathe?
I've become that someone else
Fighting for my dream, to become my reality

I can't change the way I feel
Why can't I escape this picture in me
Fucking anomaly stealing my only dream
Left a knife to my reality

Such a total fucking storm it's hysterical
Like a psychosis, I'm starving for a miracle
What the fuck just pulled this lever of hell I wish I knew

And I know fucking nothing, will I ever sleep?
Don't know bloody nothing, will I ever breathe?
Don't know fucking anything
Waiting for my dreams to become my reality

I can't change the way I feel
Why can't I escape this picture in me
Fucking anomaly stealing my only dream
Left a knife to my fucking back
Never bother, why pull that back?

It's such a bleat where we drown when we're down
I kinda need my anomaly
Such a niche where we drown all our dreams
Such keen, my anomaly

I can't change the way I feel
Why can't I escape this picture in me
If things only fell into place
Somehow I could find the change

I can't change the way I feel
I can't escape this prison in me
If things only fell in their place
Somehow I could find my place
With a knife in my fucking back
Never bother to pull that back

Such a niche where we drown all our dreams
Such keen, my anomaly

Bloodred Hourglass - The Sun Still in Me


Back in the midst of my hurricanes
I lost the spirit, I lost the trace
Another battle after battle goes on
To find the battle worth fighting for
Worked, still working on
To bring the flow back, turn it on
To find the sync from the quiet place
To put our heartbeats back in phase

Gone is chase, all attract
Believe in change when there's no turning back
We don't chase, we attract
To put our heartbeats back on track
Feel what is meant to feel (Be real)
Breathe what is left to breathe (You'll heal)
From these feelings like butterflies
That sting like a bee

You're a natural salvation
A medication for mind and soul
Took a sip to know what that is
Taste of kindness, makes fires lit
(Goddamn) This feeling refuses to die
But only wants me to die inside
Because in the end all I know
The sun does shine, yet all alone

Gone is chase, all attract
Believe in change when there's no turning back
We don't chase, we attract
To put our heartbeats back on track
Feel what is meant to feel (Be real)
Breathe what is left to breathe (You'll heal)
From these feelings like butterflies
That sting like a bee

With the sun still in me
Sing this
We don't chase, we attract
Bring in the change when there's no turning back
We don't chase, we attract
Again with all your heart
We don't chase, we attract
Bring in the change when there's no turning back
We don't chase, we attract
And give it all your fucking heart

Gone is chase, all attract
Believe in change when there's no turning back
If these feelings are butterflies that sting like a bee
You're the honey and flower, the sun still in me

Gone is chase, all attract
Believe in change when there's no turning back
If these feelings are butterflies that sting like a bee
You're the honey and flower, the sun still in me

With the sun still in me

Again with all my heart
The sun still in me, with the sun still in my heart

Bloodred Hourglass - The End We Start From


As the dimming of our light occurred
It's me against the world with a lesson learned
Burned forever underneath the rain
Tore myself apart to give you all that I could give
If forgiveness somehow let me off the hook
I feel my forever would still belong to you
Engraved for something so much more
I bleed for something I could not hold
But maybe all I need is patience and belief

If there's something I could do
Something I could say
Would you still let me know?
Could you tell mе so
Maybe one day we could find thе place
Where our hearts are not supposed to break
Where our hearts are not supposed to break

For the end we start from
Like a miracle sun, a dedicated one
You kissed me the burden and catastrophe
I lost the trust to the process
With scars in the mindset killing all polarity
This is the end we start from
Defy the loss to process
So we can trust the process
To rise back up for the better days
From the end we start from

Maybe one day we could find our place
Where our hearts are not supposed to..

If there's something I could do
Something I could say
Would you still let me know?
Could you tell me so
Maybe one day we could find the place
Where our hearts are not supposed to break
It was really truly something so special
I was only dreaming of
I never lost those feelings, my treasure
Forever I'm here waiting for
And maybe one day we could find our place
Call this loss the end we start from

Bloodred Hourglass - How's the Heart?


How's the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Could you vibe beyond with me?
How’s the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Would you sing this song with me?
Stay there for a moment
Stay there for my sake

Takeaways, the empty streets
I see the bedroom door now slightly peek
And watch the window light up the wall like a TV
Thinking this is all just a dream
Ginger shots and chocolate sweets
The real do not disturb mode on for me
Where all the waterfalls and the mountains seem
So goddamn sеcondary next to me

How's the hеart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Could you vibe beyond with me?
How's the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Would you sing this song with me?
Stay there for a moment
Stay there for my sake

The tunnels never long enough
For holding hands with a doubtful touch
I left a reservation on your bed
Maybe next time was what you said
And trains and planes when they leave
Leave behind our memory
Where holding you so caringly
Was supposed to hold the future for me

How’s the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Could you vibe beyond with me?
How's the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Would you sing this song with me?
Stay there for a moment
Stay there for my sake

How's the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Could you vibe beyond with me?
How's the heart? (hea-hea-hea-heart)
Would you sing this song with me?
Stay there for a moment (how's the heart?)
Mine once was whole
Stay there... (how's the heart?)
Mine once was whole
When I could feel yours beat right next to me

Bloodred Hourglass - Only When I'm Breathing

Stand torn, fighting, or die inside
Somehow I guess I've learned to stand my ground
So much distance for this life where
Silence keeps on waving the red flags in this reckoning
I only wish that I wished to let go
This situation has all the control
I cannot take this anymore
The fuck is wrong now?
Stand torn fighting for the peace of mind
Breathe life before this soul will die inside
There's a hole up in the heaven I've been looking up to reach
To find my place and find my remedy
All is said and done but still so much to see
Open up your eyes tonight with me
My life, I miss you, but only when I'm breathing
This heart, still there I can feel it beating
And you know
There's a hole up in the heaven I've been looking up to reach
To find my place and find my remedy
All is said and done but still so much to see
Open up your eyes tonight with me

Guess the heaven is full but the hell's fine for me
So light it up now for the distant dreams
They say that life is just an illusion and that's fine for me
But let's turn it up for the future that's there to be reached
There's a hole up in the heaven I've been looking up to reach
To find my place and find my remedy
All is said and all is done but there is so much more to see
Open up your eyes tonight with me
Looking up to reach
The remedy in me
No dreams, but obstacles are made to fall
We'll pick up the bones and carry on
It's time for the daylight to born open
To never let it break but stay
Looking up to reach
The remedy in me
Never let it break but stay

Bloodred Hourglass - Twin Flame


Who flies high will always fall so low
When you know where to place the go
Magnetic, divine, a catalyst for why
I'm stripped from all control
In the search of my soul
I see that subtle light echo in my mind

Oh my twin flame what a near miss we made
Fueled me the flame to develop a change
Distance never kills but silence truly does

Who flies high will always fall so low
Reorientate me, revalidate me
Fail means first attempt in learning
End mеans effort never diеs
It's unconditional how
It's not in the words
Love is in the heart

Oh my twin flame what a near miss we made
Fueled me the flame to develop a change
Distance never kills but silence truly does
Who flies high will always fall so low
But freedom is higher in need than love
And the worst decision of all
Would have been none

I remain as your satellite
Satellite

Oh my twin flame what a near miss we made
Fueled me the flame to develop a change
Distance never kills but silence truly does
Who flies high will always fall so low
But freedom is higher in need than love
Where the worst decision of all is always none

Lost my control but control was resistance
What is left now is filled with silent distance
Emotions led way as my superpower
Turned to a detriment
Turned to a villain, into an emptiness
Where the only way out is through
The only way out is through

Bloodred Hourglass - Oceans on Fire


Fearful faces stranded hearts
Between birth and death we all fall
Heartaches, fatal words
Cares of the waking world
Come to terms with our days and scars
As decorations
Final heartbeats giving in
Lose the battle to flatline
In my sweet end of the world
My sweet end of the world

On a day when the thoughts can be found
In a stone and six feet down the ground
Your world will bleed out of blessings
Breathe in my sweet end of the world

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift nothing learned
Where the oceans burn
Are we planning to live the night
Or paint the skies
With the ashes of the world

Burn oh my sweet end of the world
The revelation of desire and the final flame out
Fade out

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift nothing learned
Where the oceans burn
Are we planning to live the night
Or paint the skies
With the ashes of the world

If you're planning to die tonight
We'll hold the skies for a while

Die tonight
Never learn
Live the night
End of the world
If you're planning to die tonight
Don't bloody wait me
You'll bring us a world

To breathe
Drift with nothing learned
Live through the night
Grey the skies of the world

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift with nothing learned
Planning to live the night
Grey the skies of the world
Oceans on fire
Will freeze on the day
We drift to silence in safe

Bloodred Hourglass - Bastard's Seed

1 ContributorBastard’s Seed LyricsFeed it with fire
Seed it to life
Born to witness this life here
Hard not to feel the shame
Shame on you for bringing the sorrow
Earth down to her knees
In this world of greed uncontrolled, selfishly
Fuel the flames of seed
When nothing remains
The victim is stained
Where is your planet B?
Creation on hold
Now or we will fall
Crash and burn down
You feel no remorse
Buried alive we've torn open
Heart of the earth, so broken
Her sore eyes keep begging for freedom
But your pale hands keep shoveling graves
What have we done with this power
Lost the control of running this breed

This world has overcrowded, paralyzed
Blinded by the fear and lies
And I cannot believe how this humanity
Is withered in bastard's seed
You brought her so much of the hollow families
The sorrow with your useless burning greed
Creation on hold
Now or we will fall
Crash and burn down
You feel no remorse
Buried alive we've torn open
Heart of the earth, so broken
Feed it with fire
Seed it to life
Feed the fire with infinity
But you're bringing in the final destruction
We run out of air
We run out of room
Because of people like you
We run out of air
We run out of room
Until we run out of people like you

We run out of air
Until we run out of people like you
Someday you will open up your eyes and see
This world has overcrowded
Paralazed and blinded
Cannot believe my eyes
Cannot believe still you bastard's seed
Someday you will open up your eyes and see
This world has overcrowded
Paralazed and blinded
Cannot believe my eyes
Cannot believe still you bastard's seed

Bloodred Hourglass - Ethereal

1 ContributorEthereal LyricsThis vile curiosity consumed her faith
Gone into the wind with the ashes of the agony and sin
This flickering faith she fell
Turn it lose and let the omen burn
This world will keep on changing
But you never learn
Until you never wake up again
Shooting down the odds
Welcome the misfortune
We have learned to swim
Just by watching you drown
Shooting down the stars
Confined and forsaken
Confined and betrayed
We must fight through this life of our time
And never wake up again
And never wake up again
Destruct burn the witchcraft hearts
Destruct burn the fractured scars
Ancient power, lies and greed
You selfish, control your breed
Angels holding hands in the world
Soon we'll never wake up again
We will never wake up again

The world is set on fire
We have a thing to save
Save your breathe and your sermon
It's the last thing to ever retain
The world is set on fire
We have a thing to save now
You have nothing to say?
Shooting down the odds
Welcome the misfortune
We have learned to swim
Just by watching you drown
Shooting down the stars
Confined and forsaken
Confined and betrayed
We must fight through this life of our time
And never wake up again
And never wake up again
Just a crest of wave the justice
A part of what's gone wrong
Running to the outcome
We have nothing to save
Angels keep dancing 'till the end of the days
Playing the same song right till the end
And never wake up again
Soon we will never wake up again

Bloodred Hourglass - Perdition

1 ContributorPerdition LyricsLet the bloody heaven fall
We’ve already seen it all
In the destruction
We’ve had to rebuild
That’s how we’ve kept
The evolving in
Way to go, welcome the fall
Right about to lose it all
None but ourselves
Are guiding the way
Lighthouse of faith
All down from the shame
It’s all the same
You keep the change
Depress the darkness
Defile the shadows
A will to find the day
Find the day
And we will find the way
Mesmerized, paralyzed
Suckers bite their holy blood
Never had a thought
Where you gather it all
Our headaches, shit storm servants

We have the freedom, we have the will
Not exactly
We’re out of the sins
Never ever questionize my eyes
They burn the fire inside
Hide the wings to fly when
Darkness surrounds
Off the world
We’ll find our way
Depress all the darkness
Defile through the shadows
Have a will to find the day
And we’ll find the way
Depress the darkness
Defile the shadows
A will to find the day
Find the day
And we will find the way
Fly away like a firebird
Run away with the heart oh so hurt
If i let you fly alone
Will you find the way?

Bloodred Hourglass - Leaves


Did you ever really try
To figure out which you said you might
Or only separated our serenades?
Did you ever really try
To figure out what is left inside
Or only saved it for another time?

I cannot save your soul
I cannot watch you go
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every war
To find a way to carry on

I figured out which you said I might
Oh, maybe we could try another lives
Did you ever really find anything that we left behind?
Now could you find the time to say one more goodbye?
Can you still remember
Catching the falling leaves of our tree?
If you could change the day now
Is it one more day away from me
Or one more for me?

All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I cannot save your soul
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every way
To find a way to carry on

It's all now gone
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
(It's all now gone)

All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I cannot save your soul
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every way
To find a way to carry on

Bloodred Hourglass - Drag Me the Rain

If I stay we'll go too far
If I leave you may just close the only door
Leave me lost in this labyrinth of endless streets
I dare you face me with
The kiss of silence, feels so violent
I'm just missing way too much
Please sacrifice my trust
Pardon me for what I've become
This part of me has just begun
Drag me the rain that I've been asking for
That's all that I've been waiting for
Through the hallways of Hell till the entrance of Heaven
All I wish for you is sunny skies
It's just that I don't know how to feel or what to say
But I've never seen your world as clear as day
I'm going nowhеre, not that I don't know
How I'm lost into your eyes
With all your dеmons I just can not fight
Fear is contagious but so is courage
So make it rain with the latter
Care to share it now?
Our eyes, drag me the rain

So now
Drag me the rain that I've been asking for
That's all that I've been waiting for
Through the hallways of Hell till the entrance of Heaven
All I wish for you is sunny skies
Show me the way
Show me the way out, show you control
May this be the day
That it's all there I've been asking for
You bring back memories
And memories bring back devils right here
But the touch of your hand
Is all we need to make it safe for you

Bloodred Hourglass - Gone for Now


Tried to breathe the love
Valence till the fraud
Tried to take good care
But turned your highness into flaws
Gone for now
What's done for now

My words chose my mistakes
When this life threw you in
Wish things would have been different
(Would have been different)
Sometimes in the end
The silence is my friend
When the world really makes no sense
Tell me, can you taste the difference?

Done for now
Like standing on a landmine
We are one more
Step away from the last one
Gone for now
What I've done with my whole heart
I've turned my heal
To hurt me more

And then I came alive to see
Something truly seemed so different
As you may know, my friend
Our time has come to an end
I keep it quiet to be the loudest in the end
Guess our trust, it's a little different then
Mind is like a parachute
Only works when it's open
With this blocked, with this broken
Show me how much there is to lose
Broken clock is only right twice
Without a heart it's a dead machine
That is not what I fight for
I cannot fix all my flaws

Done for now
Like standing on a landmine
We are one more
Step away from the last one
Gone for now
What I've done with my whole heart
I've turned my heal
To hurt me more

Done for now
Like standing on a landmine
We are one more
Step away from the last one
Gone for now
What I've done with my whole heart
I've turned my heal
To hurt me more

So if sadness is the only emotion
That really holds something to say
Throw me away, throw me away
To build a life to cross our paths again
Gone for now
Throw me away, throw me away
Gone for now

Bloodred Hourglass - My Prime of Kneel

This is where the footprints end
This is where the final goodbyes are sent
No need to tell me that you feel sorry
I can read between the lines in the end, so don't worry
Is this the end of everything?
Or maybe just the new beginning
I guess I need to be reborn again
To learn to love with all this heart in my end
Don't wait, time is never right
Don't wait, tides will only rise
Don't wait for everything to be fine
Don't wait, just lеave it all behind
To learn to lovе again
Don't want you to wait for me
Don't need you to stay for me
I'm here to repeat my mistakes
Over and over and over again
I climbed the hardest steps
Reached, finally met
The perfect failure
Where I seem to stand on my own
Oh, my prime of
Oh, my prime of kneel

Don't wait
Don't wait
Don't wait, time is never right
Don't wait, tides will only rise
Don't wait for everything to be fine
Just leave it all behind
Where have the years all now gone by?
Where have I lost all of the signs?
All that I ever used to follow
The road now so dark and full of hollows
Tear after tear all now combined
Where have I lost all of the sight?
I don't want you to wait for me
I don't need you to stay for
My prime of kneel

Bloodred Hourglass - Rogues (Bonus Track)


As the circle drains
I'm sitting at the side of the saints and waiting
How soon will you forget
We're supposed to stay apart?
How virtuous is your mind with no mortality in mind?
I set you up this bite of lies that you just cannot hide

Save your fiery
Save your flame
No smoke without a fire
No blame without a name
Just let us live through this

Come whatever may
Let there be flames and rain
At the door of the half life
The time is here right now
Get a grip and ground
For the touch of the better times

Left unspoken
So much left unsaid
Hypocrites and renegades, you face of enemy
The way that I've been running
For this life of my own
If you want to live
Gotta stay alive and stop
Craving for the loss
Masquerades and toss
Now give me one more reason

Come whatever may
Let there be flames and rain
At the door of the half life
The time is here right now
Get a grip and ground
For the touch of the better times

So for a day
You just can't dress for the life you have
But the one you want
You goddamn rogues
With all your double standards will make us die for nothing

Give me one more reason to break
Give me one more reason to wake
Give me something
Give me something

No smoke without a fire
No blame without a name
No will without the desire
No gain without a game
No smoke without a fire
No blame without a name
Will let me fucking die for nothing

Let there be flames and rain
At the door of the half life
The time is here right now
Get a grip and ground
For the touch of the better times

Pour more blood into the water
What have we learned
Of innocence and all this weakness?
Pour more blood into the water
What have we learned
Of innocence and all this weakness?

Amorphis - Message in the Amber


Your heart is eternal
Like a bee in amber
The distant words in your gaze
Drops of blood in honey-stream
The memories of these days
And times
When moments became eternity

Fallen  No drums echo on waves
Sunken - Long-lost the kingly message
Fallen - Fallen is the herald
Sunken - Is the oaken ship

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

Just floating scraps
That search their form
Shards sinking to the bottom
Wealth and knowledge buried by mud
The magic blade covered by sand

Fallen  No drums echo on waves
Sunken - Long-lost the kingly message
Fallen - Fallen is the herald
Sunken - Is the oaken ship

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

If, by a chance, a mussel
Or a playful otter
Would take one shard ashore
Maybe someone, sometime
Should find the amber
And lift it to the sun

Your heart is eternal
Like a bee in amber
The distant words in your gaze
Drops of blood in honey-stream
The memories of these days
And times
When moments became eternity

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The death-rimed peat and mould
Eat away the castles and flags
The marsh swallows up the treasures
Thus dawns the Age of Moss
The bridge falls to the ground
Eat away the castles and flags
The trestle crumble, roads overgrow
Thus dawns the Age of Moss

The marsh swallows up the treasures
The death-rimed peat and mould
The bridge falls to the ground

Dark Tranquillity - Clearing Skies


Our backs can never carry
These atrocities around
So we focus on what's safely within reach
To market our concerns
Inside this time and place
There is nothing more you can be to me
Bring out your fear, bring out your death
Bring out your pain

For now we lie
We lie to ourselves to live
Sorrow will find you

You're the only one
Who knows things I never say
And nothing can be done
'til skies are clear again
These are things we never talk about
So hear me out this time
I know one day this sorrow will find you

Let your heroes burn their crowns
You're better than this I know
This world can change the best of us
Sometimes for the worst
Sometimes for the ones we try to hold
The ones we hold on to
Bring out your fear, bring out your death

For now we lie
We lie to ourselves to live
Sorrow will find you

You're the only one
Who knows things I never say
And nothing can be done
'til skies are clear again
These are things we never talk about
So hear me out this time
I know one day this sorrow will find you

Dark Tranquillity - Enforced Perspective

Another unit of our measure
Beyond what we can see
Our days so far
Conform to this blind metric
We let the distance set the tone
For how it travels through our time
We set our sights too far
We narrowed our scope
I hold my hand to the sky for scale
To prove my insignificance
Enforced perspective
Enforced perspective
We hold in our hands
What once had seemed unreachable
Another turn around
To face illusion
We make our innermost design
Align to a vision we deny
We set our sights too far
We narrowed our scope
I hold my hand to the sky for scale
To prove my insignificance
Enforced perspective

Enforced perspective
The power to destroy
What towers now before us
The ones that got away
Now hides within us all
That hides within us all
Retune the sight line to
Make sense of our delusion
Out of proportion
One reality fades
We grasp what we can never hold
In matters out of our control
We set our sights too far
We narrowed our scope
I hold my hand to the sky for scale
To prove my insignificance
Enforced perspective

Dark Tranquillity - Drowned Out Voices

Imagination will find a way
Imagination will find a way
To subvert what we think we know
Through co-opted voices telling lies
How do we verify, how do we verify?
Altered ways to further opinion
As it spins out of our control
No chance for consent in opinion
When distrust is the goal
Can you hear it, can you feel?
Can you see behind the chaos and the noise?
Can you hear it beyond the lies
Calling out our drowned out voices?
Imagination will find a way
Imagination will find a way
For unprovoked attacks on the tenets of trust
Foundation of community
How do we reconcile, how do we reconcile?
With baseless information
We arе woefully unprepared
No chancе for truth in words
When distrust is the goal

Can you hear it, can you feel?
Can you see behind the chaos and the noise?
Can you hear it beyond the lies
Calling out our drowned out voices?
Now
We are too easy to manipulate
Now the value of our words reside
In the space between us
We are too easy to manipulate
A simple mind for simple thoughts
The value of our words reside
Inside the space between us
Imagination will find a way
Another truth from within the lie
The first swell before another one hits
Can you hear it, can you hear it?
Can you hear it, can you feel?
Can you see behind the chaos and the noise?
Can you hear it beyond the lies
Calling out our drowned out voices?
Now
We are too easy to manipulate
Now the value of our words reside
In the space between us

The Halo Effect - Shadowminds


One side of this watershed moment
Left the fair and true objective far behind
For fear of facing what rationale resigns to
The thought of you alone with demons on your mind

Ravaging the nerves
Overtaking consciousness
What was said and what was done
Now haunt the witching hour

Let the now begin today
To the past a swift farewell
Innocence is nothing
When shadowminds prevail
Let the fear be gone today
To oblivion we cast it down
When shadowminds prevail

Let go of this, the embers of the day
Bring not the fire to the combustible night
Rather have the anger extinguish the flames
Than numbing chemicals to keep it at bay

Ravaging the nerves
Overtaking consciousness
What was said and what was done
Now haunt the witching hour

Let the now begin today
To the past a swift farewell
Innocence is nothing
When shadowminds prevail
Let the fear be gone today
To oblivion we cast it down
When shadowminds prevail


Let the now begin today

To oblivion we cast you down
Innocence is nothing
Don't let shadowminds prevail

Dark Tranquillity - Icipher


Like lust has yet to fail me
No power to subside
My instincts never broken
This downfall so close at hand

The thing that scares me most
Is the fear I see in others
And the thing that really frightens me to the core
Is when I see that fear in you

Like shields against the action
No enemy to subdue
We barricade forever
The which hides inside of us all

The thing that scares me most
Is the fear I see in others
And the thing that really frightens me to the core
Is when I see that fear in you

To break the rules and patterns when you're scared enough
Before the end is here, are you scared enough?


Are you scared enough?
Are you scared enough?

The thing that scares me most
Is the fear I see in others
That look that sends shivers down my spine
Will haunt me to the end of living days and nights

You're the thing that matters to me most
And I sense this fear in you

The Halo Effect - Become Surrender


Wake the force

Wake the force that upend the contract
Will this into existence
To be what's given, effectively decided
What has been agreed
The day of our defeat

For desire behind the lie

I don't wanna feel this real
With all this distance between us
We give in to our failures and our fears
We become surrender

Listen to the changing winds
Feel the waves of discontent (Discontent)
A reckoning averted, reality unbound
Feel the voice of our control
The voice of our control

Leave denial behind us all

I don't wanna feel this real
With all this distance between us
We give in to our failures and our fears
We become surrender
We must become surrender

The Halo Effect - Days of the Lost


To lean on the impossible
Is the failure of our dreams
The days of independence
Need revolutions to reveal

The fact, the word, the undenied
Take a shot at the lies
The way, the eyes, the nondescript
Give in to muted relief

Fall to the form
Fit into the norm

Now I see you standing all by yourself
There in the silence
I see you're all to yourself
And thеse are the hours
Thеse are the days
These are the hours
These are the days of the lost

In the end what stands to reason
Like pillars to uphold
Must be a universal
Indivisible line

Fall to the form
Fit into the norm

Now I see you standing all by yourself
There in the silence
I see you’re all to yourself
These are the hours
These are the days
These are the hours
These are the days of the lost


Now I see you standing all by yourself
There in the silence
I see you're all to yourself
These are the hours
Now I see you standing all by yourself
There in the silence
Now I see you standing all by yourself
These are the hours
These are the days
These are the hours
Days of the lost

The Halo Effect - Conditional


Let fall pretense and distance
Let rage, the failure inside
Left to instinctual forces
As it rides the hours
Take it to the end of a false beginning
What is lost to society
Break into the fortress holding us down
Lost in reality

Make true resistant progress
Against a future to hold
Regress is not in the system
As the hours burn
Break the waves of a force incoming
What is lost to society
Let us out, let us out
Let us out

Wе must go to the end of our depеndence
Light the fire, take the fall
We must go to rid us of our wants now
The state of being on the line
Conditional

This state of being, complicit with the cause
Interdependence broken

Our reality is altered
Through the fault of our own
Our reality is shifting
Conditional

We must go to the end of our dependence
Light the fire, take the fall
We must go to rid us of our wants now
The state of being on the line

We must go to the end

Take the fall
We must got to the end
This state of being

The Halo Effect - Gateways


We are of the persuasion
We are of the cause
That fail within our systems
We are the nothingness
Uphold the courtesy
While taking the crown

Rise from the inside
Rise from the norm
We are the blindness
We are the blind

Gateways to the fear among you
Lifelong race to leave behind
Deep inside the violence rages
Till the fear within you dies

Gateways to the fear among you
Lifelong race to leave behind
Deep inside the violence rages

And do you give up?
Or do you give in?

The Halo Effect - Detonate

Set off our darkest thoughts
Within these fortress walls
We're falling down inside
A depth charge waiting
The absence is everywhere
Can't get away from us
The absence is everywhere
Can't get away
We just close our eyes
We just close our eyes
Let the darkness take us
We reach out to the inside
Bеgin the journey back wherеver it ends
Break the chains of this deadlock
Before we detonate what is left
What is left of our minds
For as far as motivation will take us
The forces that are holding us down
No equilibrium, a tug of war
Our emotions will take us there
Our emotions will hold us back
With equal force
In equal measure

We just close our eyes
We just close our eyes
Before we detonate
We reach out to the inside
Begin the journey back wherever it ends
Break the chains of this deadlock
Before we detonate what is left
What is left of our minds
Before we detonate
We reach out to the inside
Begin the journey back wherever it ends
Break the chains of this deadlock

The Halo Effect - Cruel Perception


There are truths to conquer
There are fears to amplify
What is known in all we see
Is but a dark mirage
What we see, what we feel
Further behind the veil
What is broken, what is gained
Never rein in the night

There are ways to wander
Beyond the given path
There are dark encounters
Within the mind itself

Our will to see, our will to be
Our will to call the heavens
Not an answer, it's not a sign
Just an urge to wiеld the dark
There's a way, thеre is no time
A path that leads to nothing
There's a way, there is no time
Our cruel perception

To all the words not spoken
Are we dreaming hard enough?

There are ways to wander
Beyond the given path
There are dark encounters
Within the mind itself

Our will to see, our will to be

The Halo Effect - What We Become


We must endure
Unpack our failures
Resist the hardship at the onset (the onset)
Take to the argument
Another downfall strong
So rise to face adversity

Let the anger
Build a callous mind
Let the friction grind us down
Make us inured to pain
For we are stronger
Stronger than hate

When your heart is your burden
And the line must be drawn
When your self is on fire
Don't let this turn you
Into something you are not
What we become
Is something we are not

Something we are not
Something we are not

The armour laid bare
Will not desensitize
Will not be broken down
This day our will solidified

Let the anger
Build a callous mind
Let the friction grind us down
Make us inured to pain
For we are stronger
Stronger than hate

When your heart is your burden
And the line must be drawn
When your self is on fire
What we become
Is something we are not


(When your heart is your burden

The Halo Effect - Between Directions


Once there was purity of action
Once there was never-ending grace
We chartered the unknown
And steered by the hollow depths
Of our conviction and resolve

The hour is ever present
Yet we are forever behind

It all feels like I am falling
Blindly backwards into nothingness below
Always altered by emotion
We're going nowhere
No direction for me

In truth direction is deception
With understanding incomplete
Our instincts dead ahead
Informed by blind ambition
Our dedication to the night

The hour is ever present
Yet we are forever behind

There is something in the silence
Yet there's nothing I can see in front of me
Wishing this could lead somewhere
There's no direction
No direction for me

I'm stuck somewhere between
The timing makes me perfectly tense
I'm stuck somehow between (I'm stuck somehow between)

It all feels like I am falling
Blindly backwards into nothingness below

There is something in the silence
Yet there's nothing I can see in front of me
Wishing this could lead somewhere
There's no direction
No direction for me

Dark Tranquillity - The Last Imagination

Our failure to accept what ceases to be
To give up on the idea of self
We can fail to meet with our grand ideas
Can we grasp our removal from the plan?
Here at childhood's end, here at nothingness
Are we lost?
This is the last page
Of the story no one else will ever read
The last imagination
One final set of truths
When every silent scream is written
To the night eternal
This is the last imagination
One final set of truths
We refuse to be nothing worthy of measure
So lost as our time is short
Have we fled our past to embrace a now
That is over before it's begun?
Now this endless midnight, eternal dark
Is our own
This is the last page
Of the story no one else will ever read
The last imagination
One final set of truths
When every silent scream is written
To the night eternal
This is the last imagination
One final set of truths

When all that's said and done is over
With the last page written
In the story no one else will ever
No one else will ever read
This is the last page
Of the story no one else will ever read
The last imagination
One final set of truths
When every silent scream is written
To the night eternal
This is the last imagination
One final set of truths

Ensiferum - Winter Storm Vigilantes


In the realm of frost and bitter cold
Where winter's wrath begins to unfold
There dwell the brave, the valiant few
Winter storm vigilantes, mighty and true

Through the blizzards, through the storms
They won’t let evil grow
With frost in their veins and fire in their hearts
They fight the darkness, tearing evil apart

Their winged beasts soar through the frigid air
Majestic and swift, with fiery manes they wear
With snowflakes as thеir armor glints
On horses of steel, they ride to victory

In thе moonlit snow, they take their stand
Protectors of this frozen land
Their hearts are cold but they carry the flame
Winter storm vigilantes is their name

In the depths of winter's biting embrace
They chase injustice, a relentless race
Through frozen valleys and mountain peaks
Winter storm vigilantes, justice they seek

Through the blizzards, through the storms
They won't let evil grow
With frost in their veins and fire in their hearts
They fight the darkness, tearing evil apart

Oh, can you see them fly high across the skies
Their swords shine in the moonlight

The enchanted flame in the night
Guiding them forward, their purpose in sight
On steeds of steel, they ride with pride
Winter storm vigilantes, the heroes who won’t ever hide

As winter yields to the coming spring
The vigilantes' legacy, a tale to sing
Their steel horses rest until the next call
Winter storm vigilantes, the protectors of all

Through the blizzards, through the storms
They won't let evil grow
With frost in their veins and fire in their hearts
They fight the darkness, tearing evil apart

Winter storm vigilantes!

Charge!
We are invincible

When they roll the dice of destiny

Their howls rise in the night
Horses of steel shall fall, the power of the fireballs
Reset wrong to right

Ensiferum - Iron


The silence breaks the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remorseless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Felt a thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

Ride! Through the crossfire
Ride! Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride

Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood

Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
'Cause the iron is stronger than death

I go all the way, night and day
Women, booze, and money - it's all just a game
Hit and run, that's how I play
All or nothing, that's the winner's way
When I woke up this morning, everything was clear
Besides my head, who's the lady in my bed?
I'll shoot the moon, nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing, I'll be on my way to hell

Sweet lady luck on my side, I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand, I'm armed to my teeth
There is no trick in the book that I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel the embrace of the rope

I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades

Jos käy niin, että tänään kuolen
Esi-isien luo, ajan tuolle puolen

Saltatio Mortis - Finsterwacht




Dunkelheit lastet schwer auf dem Land
Die drohenden Gipfel der Berge ragen unheilverkündend in den Himmel
Nach all den Jahren ist es wieder da, dieses unheimliche Flüstern in der Nacht
Was verbirgt sich dort in den finster'n Wäldern?
Ein Sturm zieht auf, es wird kalt am Finsterkamm
Doch es gibt Hoffnung
Denn inmitten all dieser Düsternis steh'n die Hüter der Wache hoch oben auf den Türmen
Tag für Tag, Nacht für Nacht
Bereit, unsere Familien und unser Land mit ihr'm Leben zu verteidigen
Wenn sie ihre Feuer entzünden
Dann gnade uns die Göttin
Es sind die Feuer der Angst, die dort brennen
Möge der Heldenmut der Wache heller leuchten als das Licht der Flammen
Denn sie sind unsere letzte Bastion vor dem, was dort im Schatten auf uns lauert
Und unsere einzige Hoffnung dort, auf der Finsterwacht

Die Flammen lodern hoch hinauf
Zum Himmel schwarz und fern
Ein Mahnmal in der Dunkelheit
Jedes Feuer ist ein Stern
Nehmt Abschied, Freunde, singt noch ein letztes Lied
Schild an Schild gemeinsam in die Nacht
Auf der Finsterwacht

Stumme Helden ohne Rast
Die Blicke scharf wie Stahl
Vereint, von Todesmut beseelt
Steh'n wir hier ein letztes Mal
Seid wachsam, Freunde, die Schatten sind erwacht
Schild an Schild gemeinsam in die Nacht

Und steht die Welt in Flammen
Will ich mit euch durchs Feuer geh'n
Bis unsere Asche sich vereint in Ewigkeit
Und steht die Welt in Flammen
Dann werden wir uns wiederseh'n
Jenseits von hier, jenseits der Zeit


Und steht die Welt in Flammen
Will ich mit euch durchs Feuer geh'n

Feuer lodern empor
Wir sind das Licht in der Nacht

Seid der Schildwall am Ende der Welt (Wir sind das Licht in der Nacht)
Haltet den Turm, auch im Orkensturm (Rondra, erhör unsern Chor)
Steht zusammen, denn wir sind die Wacht (Komm, steh uns bei, denn wir sind die Wacht)

Haltet den Turm, auch im Orkensturm (Rondra, erhör unsern Chor)
Steht zusammen (Komm, steh uns bei), denn wir sind die Wacht

Und steht die Welt in Flammen
Will ich mit euch durchs Feuer geh'n
Bis unsere Asche sich vereint
In Ewigkeit (In Ewigkeit)
Und steht die Welt in Flammen
Dann werden wir uns wiederseh'n
Jenseits von hier, jenseits der Zeit
In Ewigkeit

Oonagh - Hörst du den Wind

Durch den Nebel der Zeit dringen Worte zu dir
Ein Vermächtnis, bewahrt nur für dich
Sie erscheinen vertraut, von unendlich weit her
Mach dich auf, wenn dein Volk zu dir spricht
Folg dem Schicksal und fürchte dich nicht
Hörst du den Wind, wie er dich ruft?
Er singt dir Lieder der alten Zeit
Aran nîn namárië
Hörst du den Wind, wenn er dich sucht?
Bringt er dir Lieder der Ewigkeit
Aran nîn namárië

Geh die Spuren zurück, deine Ahnen sind hier
Und die Zeit des Erwachens ist nah
Hör die Sagen von einst, eine Macht liegt in dir
Seit dem Anfang der Welt ist sie da
Jedes Wort deiner Seele, ist wahr
Hörst du den Wind, wie er dich ruft?
Er singt dir Lieder der alten Zeit

Feuerschwanz - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!


Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
(There's not a soul out there)
No one to hear my prayer
(No one to hear my prayer)

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimmе, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Takе me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
(There's not a soul out there)
No one to hear my prayer
(No one to hear my prayer)

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

W swojej tajemnej pracowni, gdzie sam...
Zamykam prawdziwe usta, bo ja...
Posiadam WSZYSTKIE klucze...
I nie zwątpisz nigdy...
... w niekończącą się rzekę kłamstw...
... gdy prowadzą cię w otchłani, a ty...
... tego NIE ROZUMIESZ,,,
To, co będzie już nie będzie dobre tak, jak dobre było...
I nadejdzie PrzeStrach...
Twoje życie zapłonie, a ty...
... oszukany w szaleństwie NA ZNAK...
... otworzysz w sobie... CIEMNOŚĆ...
Głód się rodzi
W noc w trup chleje...
Pan wnieWbiosie obraŻony...
Rzeź... trupy... rzeki czerwone od krwi!
Gdy u podnóża piramid nie zgadza się szmal!
Niebo dla tego, kto rozpęta piekło!
Piekło dla tego, kto nie wierzy w niebo TEGO...
... któremu od wieków i wieków WCIĄŻ BRAK!!!

... a jeśli Boga... NIE MA?
A JEDYNYM Szatanem jest TEN...
... który przekonał wszystkich, że ON...
... naprawdę istnieje...
Porozumienie Kłamców...
... u podstawy krzyża od lat...
... zabiło NIEWINNEGO by ON...
... PRZEJĄŁ NASZE WINY...
Wódz się rodzi... Zły w trup chleje...
Pan NIE PROSI - sługa KOSI!!!
Niebo dla tego, kto przejdzie przez oliwny gaj!
Piekło dla tego, kto zwątpi w JEDYNY sens słów!
Wielka nadzieja dla tych, którzy wierzą!
Wielka nagroda dla tych, którzy kłamią!
Piramidalna ściema w najlepsze wciąz trwa!
Rzeź... trupy... dzieci czerwone od krwi!!!
Gdy u podnóża piramid nie zgadza się stan!
(solo - Aka & Jelonek)
... lecz jeśli Bóg ISTNIEJE...
... i spokojnie czeka, bo ON...
... zrobi wam niezły kawał, gdy już...
... zapozna was... z... SZATANEM...
Podniesie się do życia...
... choć spoczywał jak martwy u stóp...
... Drzewa Wiecznego Kłamstwa I Łez...
... w NAOLIWIONYM gaju...

... to, co dobre już nie bedzie dobre tak, jak dobre BYŁO...
To szaleństwo trwa już tyle lat!
Otwórz oczy, weź głęboki wdech...
Chcesz szukać Boga to zacznij od SIEBIE!
Bo oni NIE WIERZĄ, bo wierzą w CIERPIENIE!!!
Gdy w dole u stóp ich piramid nie zgadza się stan!
Rzeź... trupy... dzieci czerwone od krwi!
OTWÓRZ oczy...
PRZESTAŃ W KOŃCU ŚNIĆ!!!

Hailed by the sin left our morals all behind
Blessed by the crown and to shores ahead we ride
Trails in the waves by the cross we are allied
Christ in our hearts but for mercy we are blind
Restless and damned we are knights of sacred might
We fight the Bible by our side

Sailors with no God no glory
Heroes of our story
Sinners of the Seven Seas
Traitors, may the flood await us
Bless the navigators
Sinners of the sea

West with the tides and the Bible up the mast
Onward we sail under heavens overcast
Pray to the lord that the guiding storm may last
Armed with belief and the force of the sacrament
We brave the storm, put our faith in the promised land
Soldiers of God and the conquest is our fate
Irate we sail on our crusade

Traitors, hounds and fornicators
Sainted desecrators
Sinners of the sea
Sinners, sinners of the sea

Powerwolf - Heretic Hunters


In the sign of the sacrament
On the banner of thorns
On the seventh of days in the Bible, we are born
Break the heart of a reverend
On a sabbath at dawn
On the final of days, not a god came to forewarn

Venomous, feverous, force us to run
We are credulous, ominous, thy kingdom come
One, one, one with the pyres at dawn

We are the heretic hunters tonight
We are thе heretic hunters for lifе
By the hand of our belief
And the harvest of the night
Hand up for heretic life

We are sons of the wilderness
By the sound of the horn
Running faster than light and we hunt 'em till the dawn
We are done with the heaven-sent
No messiah we mourn
In the sermon at night, full of hatred and of scorn

Venomous, feverous, force us to shout
We are tenebrous, poisonous, hellbent, and loud
Uncrowned, hold up the sacrilege proud

We are the heretic hunters tonight
We are the heretic hunters for life
By the hand of our belief
And the harvest of the night
Hand up for heretic life
Oh



We are the heretic hunters, all wild
We are the heretic hunters for life
Never forced down to our knees
We're the hardest in the fight
Fist up for heretic life

Powerwolf - Kyrie Klitorem


Kyrie Klitorem
Kyrie Klitorem

She came alive in the dark of the night
Aware no body can resist her might
And in the dark not a prayer can stop her evil touch
All we crave too much
Though heaven high, we are under her spell
Too late the psalm of temptation to tell
When late at night we all knock at her door and beg for more
Of what we adore

Kyrie Klitorem
From a silent night to the light of heavеn
Kyrie Klitorem
Bring all lust alive to thе sound of angel wings

Her sainted temple, her body, her grail
Before the dawn, lift the shine of her veil
And in the heat of the fire can't tame this instinct game
Pleasure over shame
Sin has begun, and from now it's too late
The sole command we obey; stimulate
And like a serpent in Eden we praise the poison fruit
From the top to root

Kyrie Klitorem
From a silent night to the light of heaven
Kyrie Klitorem
Bring all lust alive to the sound of angel wings

Dominae Klitorum, Ex Deum
Dominae Klitorum, Ex Deum
Dominae Klitorum, Ex Deum Est


The lesson learned by the Father, the Son
In war and pleasure, her will shall be done
And while chorales have been sung heaven made by the twist of tongue

Kyrie Klitorem
Down the alibi for the might that leads you
Kyrie Klitorem
Bring all lust alive to the sound of angels
Kyrie Klitorem
Down the alibi for the might that leads you
Kyrie Klitorem
Bring all lust alive to the sound of angels
Kyrie Klitorem

Powerwolf - 1589


1589, face the court of force divine
Filed under torment and fire
Terminate his fate on October 28th
Sentence a werewolf, a beast
Deep in the night, when they hunted in hatred
Circled the wolf in the wild
And in pale lunar light, in the shape of the savage
Guided by anger, they're blind

1589, Peter Stumpp was killed in twilight
1589, caught and filed, sacrificed
1589, in the name of thе high and mighty
1589, torture awaits the night

1589, said the murdеrer was lupine
Women and children devoured
Slayed on full-moon nights, left but traces of the bites
One-handed phantom unleashed
Creep through the night, in his fever and madness
Hunter and victim alike

1589, Peter Stumpp was killed in twilight
1589, caught and filed, sacrificed
1589, in the name of the high and mighty
1589, torture awaits the night



1589, with all spectators, stand in line
Head off, break up this beast
Feast on his cries, as the torture is calling
Hear as the screams tear the night
Burning flames of the pyre, and the crowd they are roaring
Stare as beheaded he lies

1589, in the night of a thousand fires
1589, born a wild, died alike
1589, by the hand of the court and prior
1589, legend beyond your time

Lustlos fasse ich mich an
Und merke bald, ich bin schon lange kalt

So kalt, mir ist kalt
So kalt, mir ist kalt
Mir ist kalt
So kalt, mir ist kalt
So kalt, mir ist kalt
So kalt, mir ist kalt

Soilwork - Spirit Of No Return

The realm of nothingness
Has shown its face
Consumed by a world of living pain
It crawls into your conscious
It eats your soul away
Remember who you were
On that very last day
The course of collision I fear
And ending inside your sphere
So persistently pulling me in
As dark as the night when you sin
So tell your servants
They are doomed and bound to pass
They will never stand a chance
So take your symbols down
You know they will never last
Inside the spirit of no return
-Solo-
I feel a change, inside I yearn
For something grander
I'll watch it burn

Now that my vision is clear
I levitate on command
Make way for the heavens tonight
To embrace the faults of man
So tell your servants
They are doomed and bound to pass
They will never stand a chance
So take your symbols down
You know they will never last
Inside the spirit of no return
Stuck in a cycle of pain for eternity
The weavers of your hollow dreams
So take them on and shape
Your own final destiny
It's the spirit that you have earned
And on it goes...
-Solo-
The course of collision I fear
And ending inside your sphere
So persistently pulling me in
The realm of nothingness
Has shown its face
Consumed by a world of living pain

Oh, now that my vision is clear
I levitate on command
So tell your servants they're doomed!
So tell your servants
They are doomed and bound to pass
They will never stand a chance
So take your symbols down
You know they will never last
So hail the spirit of no return
Stuck in a cycle of pain for eternity
The weavers of your hollow dreams
So take them on and shape
Your own final destiny
It's the spirit that you have earned

Roxie (POL) - Anyone I Want To Be


Used to live in the shadow
Now I’m not afraid to risk it all
I can talk a bit louder
With a power of a thunderstorm
Mam niepokorny stan
Czuję coraz mocniej dzień po dniu
Kiedy moje serce złapie rytm
Nie powiem stop, nie powiem stój

Chce unosić się na wietrze
Mogę być, tym kim zechce
Lecę tam gdzie nieznany ląd
Sięgam gdzie nie sięga wzrok

I just wanna scream at the top of my lungs
Shout it from the rooftop loud
I speak my heart and I know I can be
Anyone I want to be
Life’s never really black or white
There’s more to it than meets the eye
I speak my mind and now I know I can be
Anyone I want to be

Minuta, dwie przede mną cel
Nie wybieram dróg na skrót
Trzymam z całych sił za ster
Mogę zdobyć każdą z gór
Mam niepokorny stan
Będę sobą nawet, jeśli świat
Już napisał dla mnie inny plan
Ja powiem stop, ja powiem pas

Chce unosić się na wietrze
Mogę być, tym kim zechce
Lecę tam gdzie nieznany ląd
Dam Daram daram daram

Świat dziś mieni się milionem barw
Chowam w dłoniach cenny skarb
Nawet jeśli przyjdzie biec pod wiatr
Wiem, że możesz tak jak ja
Życie to nie tylko czerń i biel
Teraz chwytam każdy dzień
Nawet jeśli przyjdzie biec pod wiatr
Wiem, że możesz tak jak ja

Jeszcze przedwczoraj niepewność
Strach, który budził ze snu
Wystarczy chwila by móc
Zamknąć co było na klucz
Jeszcze przedwczoraj niepewność
Strach, który budził ze snu
Wystarczy chwila by móc
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh
Dam, daram daram, daram

Life’s never really black or white
There’s more to it than meets the eye

Céline Dion - My Heart Will Go On (Dialogue Mix)


Rose, you're the most amazingly astounding
Wonderful girl, woman, that I've ever known
I'm not an idiot, I know how the world works
But I'm too involved now
You jump, I jump, remember?

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls
Wearing this
Alright
Wearing only this

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'till
We're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (Why does the heart go on?)
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Go on, I'll get the next one
No, not without you
I'll be alright, listen, I'll be fine
I'm a survivor, alright? Don't worry about me
Now go on, get on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You must promise me that you won't give up
No matter what happens
Promise me now, Rose
I promise
And never let go that promise
I will never let go, Jack
I'll never let go

By now, you should've somehow
Realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)

The Red Army Choir - Катюша (Katioucha)



Расцветали яблони и груши
Поплыли туманы над рекой
Выходила на берег Катюша
На высокий берег на крутой
Выходила на берег Катюша
На высокий берег на крутой

Выходила, песню заводила
Про степного, сизого орла
Про того, которого любила
Про того, чьи письма берегла
Про того, которого любила
Про того, чьи письма берегла

Ой ты, песня, песенка девичья
Ты лети за ясным солнцем вслед
И бойцу на дальнем пограничье
От Катюши передай привет
И бойцу на дальнем пограничье
От Катюши передай привет

Пусть он вспомнит девушку простую
Пусть услышит, как она поет
Пусть он землю бережет родную
А любовь Катюша сбережет
Пусть он землю бережет родную
А любовь Катюша сбережет

Расцветали яблони и груши
Поплыли туманы над рекой
Выходила на берег Катюша
На высокий берег на крутой
Выходила на берег Катюша
На высокий берег на крутой
Выходила на берег Катюша
На высокий берег на крутой

Antonio Banderas - Canción Del Mariachi



Soy un hombre muy honrado
Que me gusta lo mejor
Pa' mujeres no me falta
Ni el dinero, ni el amor
Jineteando en mi caballo
Por la sierra yo me voy
Las estrellas y la luna
Ellas me dicen donde voy

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, mi amor
Ay, mi morena de mi corazón

Me gusta tocar guitarra
Me gusta cantar el son
Mariachi me acompaña
Cuando canto mi canción
Me gustan tomar mis copas
Aguardiente es lo mejor
También el tequila blanco
Con su sal le da sabor

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, mi amor

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

Egyszer a nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

Igen, jött egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
Így lett a föld, az ég
Zöld meg kék, mint rég
Igen, jött egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

A hajnal kelt, ő hazament
Kék hegy mögé, virág közé
Kis kék elefánt, mesét mesél
Szép gyöngyhaján, alszik a fény

Igen, él egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
Gyöngyhaj azóta rég
Mély tengerbe ért
Igen, él egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la


Igen, él egy gyöngyhajú lány

Igen, él egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Mikor nagyon egyedül vagy
Lehull hozzád egy kis csillag
Hófehér gyöngyök vezessenek
Mint jó vándort fehér kövek

Igen, ébredj, gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
Ránk vár gyöngye mögött
Ég és föld között
Igen, hív, egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán
Rám vár gyöngye mögött
Ég és föld között
Igen, hív, egy gyöngyhajú lány
Álmodtam, vagy igaz talán

Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl

“Galway Girl” is a blend of Irish folk tradition and Ed’s signature acoustic pop style. The lyrics depict a man and woman meeting in an Irish pub and dancing and singing the night away.
In his interview for… Read More 
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"

BOY (Pop) - Little Numbers

Became most famous song by BOY being played in different TV spots of “Lufthansa”.
I'm waiting for your call and for the moon
To release me from the longest afternoon
I've rearranged parts of my living room
But time is hard to kill since I met you
I'm looking at the cars that drive on by
While spring is making promises outside
Red cars are quite rare, I realize
And then I wonder which color you would like

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart and

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I watch the sky change to a darker blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singer sounds as if she was longing
As if she was longing, too

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart
And seven little numbers, baby, they could make a change
Seven little numbers make a fire out of this flame

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all?
For me at all, tell me
I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all?

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

These numbers could be lucky for you
These numbers could be lucky for you

Garmarna - Två Systrar

Å syster och syster de lade om råd
Ungt är mitt liv
Kom velom vi åt sjöastrand gå
Våller I mig den tungan
Den yngsta var viter som en sol
Ungt är mitt liv
Den äldsta var svarter som guds helga jord
Våller I mig den tungan
Den yngsta gick före med utslaget hår
Ungt är mitt liv
Den äldsta gick efter med falske råd
Våller I mig den tungan
När som de kommo till sjöastrand
Ungt är mitt liv
Då sköt den äldsta den yngsta från strand
Våller I mig den tungan
Å kära min syster hjälp mig ur nöd
Ungt är mitt liv
Dig vill jag giva min gullkrona röd
Våller I mig den tungan
Din gullkrona röd jag passar ej på
Ungt är mitt liv
Men aldrig ska du på guds gröna jord gå
Våller I mig den tungan

Å kära min syster hjälp mig i land
Ungt är mitt liv
Dig vill jag giva mitt röda gullband
Våller I mig den tungan
Å söta min syster hjälp mig i land
Ungt är mitt liv
Dig vill jag giva min fästеman
Våller I mig den tungan
Din fästeman dеn får jag ändå
Ungt är mitt liv
Men aldrig ska du på guds gröna jord gå
Våller I mig den tungan
Far nu väl min fader
Jag dricker mitt bröllop i havet
Å far nu väl min moder
Jag dricker mitt bröllop i floden
Far nu väl min syster
Ungt är mitt liv
Nu dricker mig mer än mig lyster
Våller I mig den tungan

De fiskare fiska i natten blå
Ungt är mitt liv
Så hitta de junfrun i böljan blå
Våller I mig den tungan
De togo hennes snövita kropp
Ungt är mitt liv
De togo henne ur böljan opp
Våller I mig den tungan
De togo hennes snövita bröst
Gjorde därav en harporöst
Våller I mig den tungan
De togo hennes guldgula hår
De gjorde harposträngar därav
Våller I mig den tungan
Det första slaget på gullharpan klang
Ungt är mitt liv
Så sade hon vad jungfrun hon sang
Våller I mig den tungan
Det andra slaget på gullharpan klang
Ungt är mitt liv
Våller I mig den tungan
Min syster är förbannad

Oh I’ll tell you a tale of a pirate queen
A she-wolf who reigned the Caribbean Sea
With a pistol-a-ready and a cutlass keen
The villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Born in Ireland scandalously
Bastard daughter
To a prosperous lawyer
Shunned suitor and society
For the love of a pirate boy
So Calico Jack and our Anne Bonny
Passioned lovers
Villainous plunderers
Sailed off for a life of piracy
On his ship, The Revenge, Ahoy

Oh I’ll tell you a tale of a pirate queen

But this was the 18th century
Where men make knives
And women make wives
So Anne disguised herself to be
A deadly pirate boy
Oh she plundered and murdered and raided the sea
With canons roaring
Pistols warring
She ravaged galleons mercilessly
Oh Anne Bonny
Then a fellow pirate caught a glance
Her naked chest
A woman’s breast
So she drew her cutlass and took a stand
To be Anne the Pirate Queen

Oh I’ll tell you a tale of a pirate queen
A she-wolf who reigned the Caribbean Sea
With a pistol-a-ready and a cutlass keen
The villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
And that’s when Anne met Mary Read
A pirate siren
Female tyrant
Together they terrorised the sea
A buccaneering team
Oh they plundered and murdered and raided the sea
With canons roaring
Pistols warring
They ravaged galleons mercilessly
Anne and Mary Read
On October 1720
Gold they struck
So the boys got drunk
An easy opportunity
For a ship of British marines

Anne and Mary fought alone
With cutlass flying
Pistols firing
They fought hard for their ocean throne
But lost their victory
And so the crew were captured
Thrown in prison
Death by hanging
But Anne Bonny was pardoned
For her belly held a child
So she paid her Jack a visit
And this she said
With no tear shed
‘If you had fought like a man
You wouldn’t be about to die like a dog”
And she turned on her heel
Walked out of the door
And vanished
Into legend
Oh I’ll tell you a tale of a pirate queen
A she-wolf who reigned the Caribbean Sea
With a pistol-a-ready and a cutlass keen
The villainous, infamous Anne Bonny
Villainous, infamous Anne Bonny

Othalan - Czarnobóg

1 ContributorCzarnobóg LyricsMagiczną moc, potęgę gór
Poczujesz, śmiałku, któryś tam wlazł!
Tam rządzi bowiem pradawny bóg
Który swą siłą pokonał czas
Czarnobóg - imię jego jak burza
Która niechybnie zwiastuje bój
Wędrowcze drogi, tu, na tej górze
W czarownic rękach los leży twój
Raz wejdziesz w las, nie wrócisz już
Duch w czarnym płaszczu zwabi Cię w mig
Strzeżcie się też, Ty i Twój stróż
Czarnego konia i zwodniczej mgły
"Stój, nogo! Święte są miejsca wszystkie, po których stąpasz
Wznieś się w szlaki podniebne, synu Tatr, swoim spojrzeniem
Albo przytul się raczej do ogromnego tam dębu
Co się ostał zwycięsko burzom aż do tych czasów
Gorszy od czasów zniszczenia jest człowiek, co się ośmielił
Knutem, Slawio, żelaznym na twoją porwać się szyję
Gorszy od wojny, piorunów i od pożaru też sroższy
Jest zaślepieniec, co ciska złość swą na własne swe plemię"
Niеchaj nie zwiedzie Cię uroda gór
Czy to Bеskidów, czy groźnych Tatr
Panem Diablaku jest śmierci król
A czarny motyl wiele żyć skradł

1 ContributorSogno di Volare (The Dream of Flight) Lyrics
Una Volta che Avrai
Spiccato il Volo, Deciderai
Sguardo Verso il Ciel Saprai:
Lì Casa il Cuore Sentirai!
Una Volta che Avrai
Spiccato il Volo, Deciderai
Sguardo Verso il Ciel Saprai:
Lì Casa il Cuore Sentirai!

Prenderà il Primo Volo
Verso il Sole il Grande Uccello
Sorvolando il Grande Monte Ceceri
Riempendo l'Universo di Stupore e Gloria!

Una Volta che Avrai
Spiccato il Volo, Deciderai
Sguardo Verso il Ciel Saprai:
Lì Casa il Cuore Sentirai!

L'Uomo Verrà Portato dalla sua Creazione
Come gli Uccelli, Verso il Cielo
Ooh, ooh
Riempendo l'Universo di Stupore e Gloria!

Una Volta che Avrai
Spiccato il Volo, Deciderai
Sguardo Verso il Ciel Saprai:
Lì Casa il Cuore Sentirai!

Gloria! Gloria!
